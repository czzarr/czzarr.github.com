  <div class="entry-content"><p>As all teams working on a web application, we had to setup a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuous
integration</a> server. This is
a fairly well-known engineering practice, where you want your code to be built and tested
regularly on the server so that you spot problems as soon as they arrive and not when
you push three months&#8217; worth of work to production. Also, it makes deployment a much less
stressful experience, because you know it will work. You avoid getting in the situation
of a friend of mine who could not have coffee with me because he was deploying and didn&#8217;t want
to mess it up!</p>

<p>We also wanted to take it one
step further, and use continuous deployment. As the name implies, this
means that any new code pushed to the server will automatically be
built, tested and then go live and be used by our users right away. It
turns out that is fairly easy to set up -except for a few caveats-, and
I will describe our setup. This by no means a step-by-step tutorial but
rather a &#8220;here is what you can do&#8221; article.</p>

<p><a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/" target="_blank"><img alt="Jenkins CI" src="http://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/jenkins_logo.png"></a></p>

<h2>Our Tech Stack - The Part Of It That Matters For This Article</h2>

<p>Our server runs on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, our version control system is Git
(we use <a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html">Github flow</a>) and our
code is hosted on Github. We chose to use <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> as
the CI server. Even though it is poorly documented and has a definite
&#8216;so nineties&#8217; feel, it is very easy to deploy and intuitive. Basically, you use it
to set up jobs that are run when you launch them manually or when an external event, such
as a code push, is triggered. These jobs can be anything that&#8217;s executable, I usually use
simple bash scripts but you can use any kind of script, makefiles and so on.</p>

<h2>Install And Keep Jenkins Up And Running At All Times</h2>

<p>Jenkins is contained in a WAR file, so you can simply download and execute it with
java (command <code>java -jar /path/to/jenkins.war</code>). Of course, this is only
suitable for testing purposes. In production, you will want to use an
<a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/">Upstart</a> script so that Jenkins respawns if
it crashes unexpectedly and starts on boot.</p>

<p>When Jenkins is up, you have
access to a web interface to manage it (you can configure the port on which
it listens). Make sure to enable security -I recommend matrix based security- unless you want anyone to be
able to take control of your servers! One thing to watch out for is that
you need to enable the &#8220;overall read&#8221; permission for the anonymous user,
or else Jenkins won&#8217;t be able to communicate with third-party services - in our case Github and Hipchat. Pretty stupid
behaviour I know, but at least it doesn&#8217;t create security holes.</p>

<h2>Build On Push To Master</h2>

<p>We have the Git and Github plugins enabled. The <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Github+Plugin">Github plugin</a>
enables us to connect Jenkins to Github&#8217;s post-receive hook. That way,
whenever someone pushes to master (usually by merging a feature branch),
our Jenkins &#8220;build&#8221; job pulls the new version of the code, builds it and
test it. For us, that&#8217;s really a two-line script, as we <a href="http://www.mikealrogers.com/posts/nodemodules-in-git.html">check all
modules in to Git</a>.</p>

<p>If everything was successful, the &#8220;deploy&#8221; job is now called. It pulls
the new version of the code in the live repository, then restarts the
node server (since we use nodejs, we can overwrite the javascript files
when the server is running without impacting it). Node starts pretty
fast, so we only have ~0.1s downtime (no load balancer to achieve 0s downtime - for now!). And since we use an external store
to manage sessions, nobody gets logged out.</p>

<h2>Be Notified</h2>

<p>The last part of the puzzle is how we get notified of the build result.
We use <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/">Hipchat</a>, so we installed the Hipchat
plugin that notifies us of build results in a dedicated chat room. Most
of the time it just says &#8220;Build successful&#8221;. But no sweat if a build
fails, since the &#8220;deploy&#8221; job was not called our users don&#8217;t see
anything wrong!</p>

<h2>And That&#8217;s All There&#8217;s To It!</h2>

<p>Yup. It is indeed simple enough to get a robust continuous deployment
system up and running, that most of the time safely deploys your code
through a simple <code>git push</code> on your part. I&#8217;m interested in anything you
would have to say on this setup or any tip you&#8217;d like to share!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At Google I/O there were <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-io-product-announcements-2012-6?op=1">many interesting announcements</a>: <a href="http://gigaom.com/mobile/nexus-7-first-look-its-here-to-snuff-kindles-fire/">Nexus 7</a>, Google
Glass, etc. (Perhaps too many as one can say that <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/06/27/google-vs-everyone/">Google is fighting too
many ennemies on too many fronts</a>).
One news that drew my attention is the arrival of Google Chrome on iOs. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/28/hands-on-with-googles-chrome-for-ios-just-like-chrome-for-android-only-slower/">Don&#8217;t expect browsing
experience improvement</a>
you had on your desktop as this app is merely a graphical
layer on top of Apple&#8217;s WebView from its SDK. Basically the engine is the same as Safari &#8230;
just slower.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not my point. I want to talk about the sync functionnality
that Google Chrome on iOS offers: by activating the sync on your
different devices (desktop, iPad, iPhone&#8230;) you can open a tab you were
viewing in one device on another one. The <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/26/a-modest-proposal-the-continuous-client/">Continous Client</a> becomes real.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://img802.imageshack.us/img802/3818/passthebaton.jpg" width="340"></p>

<blockquote><p>So what is a Continuous Client you ask? Well the premise is simple: when you leave one device, you pick up your session in exactly the same place on the next device you use. Meaning your IM, Twitter, web browsing, applications, even your windows appear just as they did on the previous device. The situation I describe above would be obviated by this setup, allowing me to move from my laptop to iPad in a seamless manner which would in no way disrupt the activity I was currently engaged in. [&#8230;] Put simply, you are placeshifting your computing experience from one device to the next with no break in your work, timelines, or conversations.</p></blockquote>

<p>After using the cloud to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">store persistent data easily</a> and
<a href="https://www.icloud.com/">seamlessly</a>,
one can now use it as a relay to get a continuous browsing experience
across different devices.</p>

<p>We can moreover imagine various implementations of the continuous client to enhance our global user experience.
For example, <a href="http://www.invoxia.com/en/">Invoxia</a> with its business dock adopts the same
vision for phone by bridging mobile and office calls.</p>

<p>My experience of these two continous clients is so magic but nonetheless so
natural that I&#8217;m looking forward to future ones that will be invented to make our everyday life even more
pleasant and interruptions-free.</p>

<p>And you, do you know another usecase where a continuous client architecture is
already available?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On <a href="http://freddestin.com/2012/06/get-your-kid-coding-with-codeclub-with-free-viral-video.html">Fred Destin&#8217;s initiative</a>, the big stars
at <a href="http://foundersforum.eu/">Founders Forum</a>, including Niklas ZennStröm
(Skype), Chad Hurley (Youtube) and many others, shooted last week a funny
and viral video to promote <a href="http://www.codeclub.org.uk/">CodeClub</a>.
CodeClub is a brilliant action which aims at <em>inspiring kids to learn
code and creating a nationwide after school coding club for children aged 10-11</em>.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/FxhGIajRsq4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Kids are the future, everybody knows it. Computer are, too. When we see what
our generation&#8217;s geniuses made and how they revolutionized our world
when computer science and coding were at their premises, one
can only urge the next generation to dive into code as
soon as possible.</p>

<p>Supporting this initiative is supporting a long term vision for our
economy and our education system. There is no day without reading that
there is a big lack of great programmers, that <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/060412-data-scientist-259697.html">data-scientist is the
hottest job at this time</a>
or that <a href="http://www.elezea.com/2012/04/programming-and-thinking/">learning to code is a great move</a>.
So we should foster our kids to embrace this activity as soon as
possible as informatics, hardware will be everywhere. By extending the base
of people having the skills to program we foster the future innovation.</p>

<p>The earlier we start learning something the better we are good at it and the
less we fear it. We belong to a generation where there is
still a big proportion of people who are not at ease with computers or
smartphones. Even an entreprising friend of mine judges that it&#8217;s too
late for him to start learning how to code whereas he&#8217;s only 25! But have you
experienced <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXV-yaFmQNk">kids change of behaviour</a> towards our world?
I don&#8217;t think there will be many kids in 10 years who won&#8217;t know how to
use a smartphone. And I do want to think that these kids in 10 years won&#8217;t
be as reluctant to learn code as people can be today. Perhaps the
qualifiers <em>geeky</em> or <em>nerd</em> won&#8217;t exist anymore, or have a very distant meaning,
commensurate to what these people have created by now.
Who knows ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, <a href="http://robgo.org/about/">Rob Go</a> from <a href="http://nextviewventures.com/">NextViewVentures</a>
explained why in his opinion people should <a href="http://robgo.org/2012/05/14/think-twice-before-starting-a-company/">think twice before starting a
company</a>: too much
hype, harder to stand out, we are at the end of one innovation cycle and at the beginning of a new one
which is less favorable to unexperienced and non-technical founders.</p>

<p>So to the question <a href="http://robgo.org/2012/06/10/what-to-do-instead-of-starting-a-company/"><em>What to do instead of starting a company?</em></a>
he answers: <em>Join the winningest company you can find in a sector you care about with people you like</em>.
Should you agree or not, this recommendation has its pros and cons but one can&#8217;t come to
a decision easily. The most important lesson to learn comes at the end:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/2324/imagerxss.jpg" width="220"></p>

<blockquote><p>I think there is just the inherent satisfaction of being a part of a
company that is making a big dent in the world.  We’d all like to be the
person who started that company, but there is a huge amount of pride to
be had in being a contributor, even if you aren’t a leader.  Also,
scale and success give companies the right to do something meaningful.
I often hear founders of failed companies lament “I realized that I
just wasn’t that excited about X, Y, or Z market.”  Well, the truth
is, most people probably aren’t that excited about about helping
merchants process credit cards (until Square) or the apartment
rental industry (until Air BnB) or local advertising (until FourSquare),
or the private car industry (until Uber) etc etc. Being part of a successful
company that is shaping the future of an industry is usually inherently
interesting and motivating, and it’s a great way to spend a few years
of your life until the time is right for you to start a company that will do the same.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s a very interesting analysis as he doesn&#8217;t try to give a clear cut
and general solution applicable to everybody. Instead he takes into
account the personality of people who could be disposed to start a
company, noting that founding a startup is not necesseraly the best fit for them.
The true concern one should have is to make a dent in the world. <a href="http://markbivens.com/m/about">Mark Bivens</a>
came to the same conclusion: <a href="http://markbivens.com/m/archives/feeling-a-part-of-something-bigger">People need to feel a part of something bigger</a>
and joining a startup could be the best answer to this feeling. It will never be
be too late to found its company after such an experience, on the
contrary it can only make things easier.</p>
