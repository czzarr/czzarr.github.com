  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Yo dawg, we heard you like reading Hacker News, so we put summaries in your links</h2>

<p>When you discovered that Superman could see through walls you told yourself that it was the awesomest thing ever. Naturally you wanted to have the same superpower.
Well let&#8217;s say you can do that now on your browser and <strong>see through hyperlinks with our Chome Extension</strong>.</p>

<p>You love reading the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> front page articles. But you don&#8217;t always have the
time to click the links and read them all. That&#8217;s
why we built this Chrome extension that enables you, <strong>simply by hovering over a
link, to read a summary of the article.</strong> How exciting is this?</p>

<p>Here is what this looks like:</p>

<br><img src="http://i.imgur.com/LEwCV.png" alt="Tldr extension screenshot">




<br>


<p><a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tldr/ohmamcbkcmfalompaelgoepcnbnpiioe" style="padding:25px;background:#008CD4;display:block;width:200px;margin:30px auto 0px auto;font-size:22px;font-family:CassanetBold, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica,border-radius:5px;color:white;border-radius:5px; text-align: center;" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Buttons', 'Click', 'Go to CRX install page']);">Install this awesome extension!</a></p>

<h2>Why does it only work on Hacker News? I want it everywhere!</h2>

<p>We know. We want that too. But as you know, <strong>our summaries are
human-written</strong> because <a href="http://needforair.com/blog/2012/04/06/why-computers-are-bad-at-summarizing-text/">computers are bad at summarizing</a>.
Today, the community writing summaries is still very small and can&#8217;t handle a huge load. We summaries
them to be of the highest quality, so we chose to focus on Hacker News
so that we could bring a lot of value to our users while still having
the time to run our company.</p>

<p>You can help! If you like to find the key information in a technical
blogpost, if you want to help other people fight the information
overload or if you simply want tldr.io&#8217;s coverage of the front page to
be even higher, you can <a href="http://tldr.io/whatisit#install-bm-section"><strong>use our contribution bookmarklet</a>
and start creating summaries</strong> too. We review all the summaries our users
create to ensure they stick to the original author&#8217;s point of view, but
your contributing really helps the community.</p>

<h2>Why is it a Chrome extension? I want it on Firefox!</h2>

<p>We too! We&#8217;re currently focusing on a Chrome extension to see how people
use it and how useful they find it. Once we think we have a clear idea
of what the extension should be, we will make a Firefox version. If you
have some ideas, <a href="http://tldr.io/forum/topics/50a4b8f45f5d3cd04a0001b7">please tell us here, we are interested</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2><a href="http://tldr.io">tl;dr</a> (too long; didn&#8217;t read)</h2>

<p>We&#8217;re super excited to announce that we have finally launched our new product: <strong>tl;dr</strong>!
The three of us quit our dayjobs at the end of 2011 and for the past 5 months we&#8217;ve been hard at work on it, and we&#8217;re very
proud of what we&#8217;re releasing.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, our product solves the problem of wanting to know what&#8217;s in a webpage
without losing precious time. It allows you to display a summary of the webpage you&#8217;re
currently browsing. The summaries are written by people who found the
webpage interesting before you. If the summary you&#8217;re asking for doesn&#8217;t exist yet,
you&#8217;ll be offered to create it. We decided to rely on people because summarizing
information is a skill people are vastly better at than computers.</p>

<h2>So why did we build this product?</h2>

<p>We read a lot of blogs, be it news or
more educational/topical content. It&#8217;s been said and resaid that we&#8217;re
in an age of information overload. There is simply too much content that
is published everyday and it&#8217;s getting harder and harder to not only keep up with
the firehose but also filter what needs to be read and remembered. Often times we feel like it would
be nice to have access the few key ideas that are worth remembering of an
article we just read.</p>

<p>We also thought <em>&#8216;Wouldn&#8217;t it be cool if upon arriving on a web page we
could display its summary to rapidly see what it&#8217;s about?</em> Indeed
everyone now knows to choose catchy titles to attract readers. Other signals such as
likes, shares, or upvotes aren&#8217;t really related to the actual content
and need of the reader. We wanted something that focused on the content,
so that people would be able to make their own opinion about it.
This is why we decided to allow people to attach one
summary to any URL on the web in order to describe what&#8217;s in it. Sort of
an entry point to each webpage. Turns out there&#8217;s already an name for
such a summary on the internet: it&#8217;s <strong>tl;dr</strong>. Once it is written, the tl;dr benefits
everybody in the world. Anyone will be able to get a clean, standardized
preview of what the webpage they&#8217;re about to browse contains. This can be
very useful on unknown busy webpages that are hard to sift through.</p>

<p>At this point we must point out that we do not want to prevent people
from reading original content. We simply want to pique the interest of the
right people and drive them to content they&#8217;re looking for by lowering
its barrier to entry for them. Since we believe that summarized
information is one of the most powerful force that drives interest (as
evidenced by academic paper abstracts, google results extracts, etc.) we
think people-contributed summaries will work wonders.</p>

<h2>A word of caution</h2>

<p>This is our first release and shouldn&#8217;t be considered perfect. There is
still a lot of work ahead of us, we have a big and clear vision for our
company but we&#8217;re taking baby steps. You should expect new features
regularly, as well as bugs! Besides, since we are building a company,
and a company needs to make money, expect some pricing plans for our
service to come out very soon. For those interested, we&#8217;ve been
bootstrapping for now and haven&#8217;t taken any investor money.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>tl;dr version</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>We should stop having software handle system tasks like daemonization
or privilege-dropping</em></li>
<li><em>That&#8217;s a job for a supervisor. For example we use <a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/">Upstart</a></em></li>
<li><em>Nodejs plays nicely with Upstart, for example see <a href="https://gist.github.com/3385102">this Upstart
script for launching a nodejs application</a></em></li>
</ul>


<p>We are currently building a webapp with the following stack: nodejs,
mongoDB, nginx and redis. We also use a certain number of services,
like <a href="http://needforair.com/blog/2012/07/09/jenkins-in-production/">Jenkins</a> and Graphite.
To use these softwares in production, we need to be able to daemonize
them, run them as specific users (usually with low privileges), and have
tham restart automatically if case of an unexpected crash.</p>

<p><a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank"><img alt="Jenkins CI" src="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/img/upstart80.png"></a></p>

<p>These are quite common needs. But people are often confused as to what
part of the system is responsible for what task. I often see software
handling the privilege drop (for example the otherwise excellent
<a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/">Graphite</a>), or the daemonization (for
example <a href="http://gunicorn.org/">gunicorn</a> - which is also great
otherwise). It&#8217;s bad, because as a result, some of these softwares don&#8217;t
play nicely with supervisors like Upstart. People tend to resort to
strange and not well understood scripts (I even saw an Upstart script
that called the <em>start_stop_daemon</em> to launch a gunicorn process which
daemonized itself!).</p>

<p>There is a simple rule to follow to avoid this confusion:
<strong>softwares should not daemonize or handle privilege drop</strong>. These are
jobs for the supervisor. That&#8217;s all, separation of concerns, folks. For
example, we use Upstart to launch our processes as services. That way,
we get added benefits: they get respawned in case they crash, they
restart automatically if we need to reboot the server, and we can
specify rules such as &#8220;service A should not start before service B has started
and is ready&#8221;. I see no reason not to it that way!</p>

<p>An example of software that respects these rules is nodejs. Here is <a href="https://gist.github.com/3385102">the
Upstart script</a> we use with it. It enables us to start our app as any
user, log all output and get the added benefits I was referring to
earlier. It really is all you need with nodejs and most software you
will use. This is not an Upstart tutorial (<a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/">their doc</a> is pretty good),
but let me explain the most important parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>The privilege drop is done through the <code>su -s /bin/sh -c 'exec "$0" "$@"' $RUN_AS -- command</code> part.
This line executes <code>command</code> as user <code>$RUN_AS</code>. Unfortunately, we have to use this method because the standard
<code>sudo -u</code> doesn&#8217;t work from within an Upstart script.</li>
<li>The log file needs to be <code>touch</code>ed in case it doesn&#8217;t exist, then <code>chown</code>ed to user <code>$RUN_AS</code>, because otherwise
it will belong to user root (which the user executing the Upstart script)</li>
<li>The rest is pretty standard</li>
</ul>


<p>Of course, this script doesn&#8217;t work just for nodejs! So you have no excuse not to use it now :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As all teams working on a web application, we had to setup a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuous
integration</a> server. This is
a fairly well-known engineering practice, where you want your code to be built and tested
regularly on the server so that you spot problems as soon as they arrive and not when
you push three months&#8217; worth of work to production. Also, it makes deployment a much less
stressful experience, because you know it will work. You avoid getting in the situation
of a friend of mine who could not have coffee with me because he was deploying and didn&#8217;t want
to mess it up!</p>

<p>We also wanted to take it one
step further, and use continuous deployment. As the name implies, this
means that any new code pushed to the server will automatically be
built, tested and then go live and be used by our users right away. It
turns out that is fairly easy to set up -except for a few caveats-, and
I will describe our setup. This by no means a step-by-step tutorial but
rather a &#8220;here is what you can do&#8221; article.</p>

<p><a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/" target="_blank"><img alt="Jenkins CI" src="http://jenkins-ci.org/sites/default/files/jenkins_logo.png"></a></p>

<h2>Our Tech Stack - The Part Of It That Matters For This Article</h2>

<p>Our server runs on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, our version control system is Git
(we use <a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html">Github flow</a>) and our
code is hosted on Github. We chose to use <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/">Jenkins</a> as
the CI server. Even though it is poorly documented and has a definite
&#8216;so nineties&#8217; feel, it is very easy to deploy and intuitive. Basically, you use it
to set up jobs that are run when you launch them manually or when an external event, such
as a code push, is triggered. These jobs can be anything that&#8217;s executable, I usually use
simple bash scripts but you can use any kind of script, makefiles and so on.</p>

<h2>Install And Keep Jenkins Up And Running At All Times</h2>

<p>Jenkins is contained in a WAR file, so you can simply download and execute it with
java (command <code>java -jar /path/to/jenkins.war</code>). Of course, this is only
suitable for testing purposes. In production, you will want to use an
<a href="http://upstart.ubuntu.com/">Upstart</a> script so that Jenkins respawns if
it crashes unexpectedly and starts on boot.</p>

<p>When Jenkins is up, you have
access to a web interface to manage it (you can configure the port on which
it listens). Make sure to enable security -I recommend matrix based security- unless you want anyone to be
able to take control of your servers! One thing to watch out for is that
you need to enable the &#8220;overall read&#8221; permission for the anonymous user,
or else Jenkins won&#8217;t be able to communicate with third-party services - in our case Github and Hipchat. Pretty stupid
behaviour I know, but at least it doesn&#8217;t create security holes.</p>

<h2>Build On Push To Master</h2>

<p>We have the Git and Github plugins enabled. The <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Github+Plugin">Github plugin</a>
enables us to connect Jenkins to Github&#8217;s post-receive hook. That way,
whenever someone pushes to master (usually by merging a feature branch),
our Jenkins &#8220;build&#8221; job pulls the new version of the code, builds it and
test it. For us, that&#8217;s really a two-line script, as we <a href="http://www.mikealrogers.com/posts/nodemodules-in-git.html">check all
modules in to Git</a>.</p>

<p>If everything was successful, the &#8220;deploy&#8221; job is now called. It pulls
the new version of the code in the live repository, then restarts the
node server (since we use nodejs, we can overwrite the javascript files
when the server is running without impacting it). Node starts pretty
fast, so we only have ~0.1s downtime (no load balancer to achieve 0s downtime - for now!). And since we use an external store
to manage sessions, nobody gets logged out.</p>

<h2>Be Notified</h2>

<p>The last part of the puzzle is how we get notified of the build result.
We use <a href="https://www.hipchat.com/">Hipchat</a>, so we installed the Hipchat
plugin that notifies us of build results in a dedicated chat room. Most
of the time it just says &#8220;Build successful&#8221;. But no sweat if a build
fails, since the &#8220;deploy&#8221; job was not called our users don&#8217;t see
anything wrong!</p>

<h2>And That&#8217;s All There&#8217;s To It!</h2>

<p>Yup. It is indeed simple enough to get a robust continuous deployment
system up and running, that most of the time safely deploys your code
through a simple <code>git push</code> on your part. I&#8217;m interested in anything you
would have to say on this setup or any tip you&#8217;d like to share!</p>
