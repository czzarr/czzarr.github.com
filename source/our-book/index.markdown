## We Wrote a Book!
While we began working on our startup, we spent quite some time researching the most 
efficient workflow and tools. As we wanted to write our findings down, we decided it 
was best to use the ebook format so that anyone can read them.

## Summary
So you've got that big idea, and hopefully even one or more cofounders and you're just about to get shit done. But then you hit a wall, actually a few walls, one by one... How are you going to communicate ? How do you keep a knowledge base ? How do you setup your workflow, environments, etc. All the right information is available online, only it is fragmented in a bajillion places like Quora, Stack Exchange, or worse: blogs. That's why we decided to write this book after spending a few weeks reading up on every resource available for each topic, trying and arbitraging between some of the solutions described. It is an opinionated guide in the sense that it is of course not the only solution. We tried to strike the perfect balance between learning curve, reusable skills, money spent, and time used.
