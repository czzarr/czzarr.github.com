I [already wrote](http://needforair.com/blog/2012/04/04/what-we-didnt-learn-in-college/) about how 
some [existing platforms](https://github.com/) could be leveraged to build
our visbility over the internet but they offer much more.

## How platforms can structure communities

We can call these platforms _community organizing platforms_ because
they allow a community to have a place to gather, discuss and share. They
provide a global structure for organizing the community. They are the
new forums in the social web.  

With these platforms everyone within the community has its business card
accessible with the records of its activity and has the potential to be someone. 
People can easily be identified, followed and consulted. The necessity to go to
conferences or events is considerably lowered: the community can 
live online. 

## Community organizing platforms are not just social networks

We can see in generic existing social networks like Twitter a way to 
organize communities but Twitter doesn't provide all the structure
other more specified platforms do. It's a sharing network but not a
collaborative network.

While community organizing platforms are built upon a social network layer they
offer more services geared towards the community itself. They disrupt
the way the community can be organized by fulfilling the community's
needs with adequate tools. [Nation Builder](http://nationbuilder.com/)
is the perfect example how these platforms can help the communities to
organize themself: it provides in one place all the tools leaders need to have to reach, drive 
and communicate with their community.  


## Knowledge is a commodity in active communities 

We can distinguish communities built upon friendship, professional
activity or common interests. Most acitve communities
are the ones who share a common interest, where knowledge and
feedback is a commodity. In these communities people spend a lot of time
looking for information and digesting resources because it's what gives
them credit. Platforms structuring these little community are even more
important because the resources they want access to are not always well
indexed by search engines.  

As sharing information, working collaboratively and giving feedbacks to pairs is a key point in
these community even a very little one
can be very active, if based on a common passion. 
There is still lots of
these communities to structure out there, lots of people waiting to
collaborate with their pairs. How should it be done?
