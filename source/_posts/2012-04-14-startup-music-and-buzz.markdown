The challenges a startup faces, other creative initiatives face them.
[Leanpub](http://leanpub.com/) in his
[manifesto](http://leanpub.com/manifesto) points out the similarities
between writing a book and launching a startup: _Both are risky, creative
processes, often undertaken in stealth mode and with hit-driven economics._   

The same parallel can be drawn with the music industry or more generally
with independant creative activities. Crowdfunding platform
[MyMajorCompany](http://www.mymajorcompany.com/) or [KickStarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/) 
illustrates the similarities between all these processes. 
Independant singers who are not supported by famous productors bear the risk, 
have to build their _product_ and develop their marketing
strategy on their own. 

Once the beta version of the product is ready to showcase, a single in
the case of singers, a difficulty is to market it. How can one give it
some traction? One option that seems profitable is to place the
product in a favourable context by attaching it to an event which
benefits from a good media coverage. The medias have such a big impact
on the crowd that they can drain lots of attention. Leverage these
media can seems very valuable.  

Recently in France a singer succeeded to create the buzz
on the internet, hitting more than 600 000 views on Youtube, with its
single on a candidate to the presidential elections. In the same veine
as _I got a crush on Obama_ she drew the media attention in a very
effective way by leveraging the current context.

Make the buzz gives the impression today to succeed. But how can we be
less certain? Does a spike in the audience really help to succeed with
his product? When one realize that [90% of the companies appearing on TC
are abandoned within 6 months](http://simply.io/blog/2012/03/welcome-to-the-real-world-just-because-youre-on-techcrunch-doesnt-mean-youve-won/) 
one can question the relevance of the press coverage and the buzz one
can create to build a durable success. One concern one should have
instead is building an audience. Successfull startups and creators don't
rely on a single shot try, they build their success gradually as the same
time as their audience.
