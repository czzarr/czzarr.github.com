Last week, [Rob Go](http://robgo.org/about/) from [NextViewVentures](http://nextviewventures.com/) 
explained why in his opinion people should [think twice before starting a
company](http://robgo.org/2012/05/14/think-twice-before-starting-a-company/): too much 
hype, harder to stand out, we are at the end of one innovation cycle and at the beginning of a new one 
which is less favorable to unexperienced and non-technical founders.  
 
So to the question [_What to do instead of starting a company?_](http://robgo.org/2012/06/10/what-to-do-instead-of-starting-a-company/)
he answers: _Join the winningest company you can find in a sector you care about with people you like_. 
Should you agree or not, this recommendation has its pros and cons but one can't come to 
a decision easily. The most important lesson to learn comes at the end:

It's a very interesting analysis as he doesn't try to give a clear cut
and general solution applicable to everybody. Instead he takes into
account the personality of people who could be disposed to start a
company, noting that founding a startup is not necesseraly the best fit for them. 
The true concern one should have is to make a dent in the world. [Mark Bivens](http://markbivens.com/m/about)
came to the same conclusion: [People need to feel a part of something bigger](http://markbivens.com/m/archives/feeling-a-part-of-something-bigger)
and joining a startup could be the best answer to this feeling. It will never be 
be too late to found its company after such an experience, on the
contrary it can only make things easier.
