## Twitter identities are very lightweight

This is not news, Chris Poolem the founder of 4chan and canv.as, and
Fred Wilson have talked about it before. It is a very big deal though.

The reasons are  twofold: firstly a Twitter profile is reduced to the
bare minimum, which is a nickname, an avatar and a short bio. This means
that people aren't afraid to share their Twitter profile with the whole
world, as there is nothing private or intimate in there. But secondly,
and this is more subtle, the evanescent character of the Twitter
streams entail that people don't really need to care too much about
what they tweet. It's gonna get lost in a few hours anyway. So tweets
are not the same kind of burden as facebook photos. A Twitter identity
doesn't carry the same weight as a facebook identity.

As a result, people that worry about online privacy should gladly be
using Twitter authentication as opposed to Facebook authentication. You
really don't reveal much about your private self when you share your
tweets.

## 140 characters enable improbable conversations

That length constraint compels people to get straight to the point.
There is no fluff. No awkward openings, no pompous endings, no walls of
text. People expect direct questions and wouldn't have it any other
way.

This magicly enables you to talk to some people you would never have sent an
email to. And busy people that don't know you at all, that might be
thought leaders or experts whereas you are a nobody, will answer you if
you ask an interesting question. Because the constraint also works for
the response: they don't have to send you a long well thought-out answer,
they don't need to get context to answer, they can just type 140
characters.

I have asked questions to succesful entrepreneurs, or VCs, and almost
always gotten a quick answer. This is incredibly cool and powerful. And
these people don't know me at all.
