In the past years, we have seen a lot of developped countries
governments pushing for more regulation of the Internet, and less
privacy for users. There are three main reasons: protection of
children, prevention of terrorism and [fight against illegal downloading](http://needforair.com/blog/2012/03/29/sopa-hadopi-future-of-culture/). This has led to very repressive and usually inefficient laws, for example in Australia, in France (Hadopi) and [possibly soon](http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/220181-dodd-says-sopa-can-live-again) in the US. I think that a big part of this problem is that a very large portion of the people making these laws understand next to nothing about the Internet, and are thus afraid of it. What can we do about it?

## Direct education is not enough
Direct education is the most natural answer. Initiatives like Google's
[20 things I learned about browsers and the Web](http://www.20thingsilearned.com/en-US) for example, aim at explaining very simply the basics to beginners. More focused initiatives like the [electronic G8 forum](http://www.eg8forum.com/en/), which was held last year in Paris are interesting too. But unfortunately, none of these will make a real impact as long as politicians have so little interest for this world. What we really need is to make them **want** to learn about the Internet.


## The Pirate Party can play a significant role
What politicians really care about is of course to get (re)elected. And
since they are busy people, they only tackle the subjects they feel are the
most importants for voters, which are nowadays the economic crisis and
unemployment. This is where I think the [Pirate Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party) has a huge role to play. Even though they are still a fringe party today, they [have had some electoral success](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/world/europe/in-berlin-pirates-win-8-9-percent-of-vote-in-regional-races.html) and have shown the political world that voters do care about Internet-related issues. If they continue to be successful, I am pretty sure that mainstream politicians, who hold the real power, will want to understand the Internet better, leading to a more fruitful public debate.  

It will surely take some time, but I think **it will happen**, because it already happened in the past: 30 years ago, neither voters nor politicians cared about the environment, and the Green parties were regarded the same way the Pirate party is today. Now, ecology is a significant political topic in many European countries. The Internet is next.
