The copyright industry is busy trying to force the US to adopt the SOPA
law while its French counterpart, Hadopi, is already up and
running. This brings two questions:

* What will be the future model for accessing culture? Will today's
  giants be part of it?
* How can we ensure that laws are made by people with sufficient
  knowledge of the field they try to regulate?

I will cover the first question in this post and the second one in a few
days.

## Dying industries in this new era
Since the beginning of the "Internet at home" era, the music and movie
industries have been fighting tooth and nail against filesharing.
Deeming filesharers "pirates", they spent the last decade suing a lot of
P2P users, protecting CDs and DVDs with DRMs and lobbying for a strict control of
the Internet.  

Basically, their line is "if you don't want what we
offer, when we offer it and at the price we're offering it, you always have
the option of not getting it". They may be right, but they're not [pragmatic](http://www.marco.org/2012/02/25/right-vs-pragmatic "pragmatic"). Consumers don't like to pay for CDs that are DRM-locked, or for a zone 1 DVD that only works in 2 countries and begins with a 10 minutes ["illegal downloading is ripping out a beating human heart" ad](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWPfcEOr2Yg "Bender piracy warning"). In fact, consumers don't even want to drive to the nearest Virgin Megastore to get the latest season of Game of Thrones.  

That's why these industries will die eventually: they try to stick to
their old business model of selling *products* (CDs, DVDs, MP3 files) laden with commercials while the public only
wants access to *culture* (songs, movies, series, books). And the Internet has proven
to be pretty good at providing exactly this, for free.


## People still want to pay for what they love
Does that mean that artists are doomed to be left destitue as consumers get their work for free, as the story championed by these
industries go? Of course not! People want to pay for what they love.
For example, you can look at [Flattr](http://flattr.com/ Flattr). Or you
can consider the fact that [Radiohead made between $6M and $10M from a
"pay-what-you-want" album](http://www.wired.com/listening_post/2007/10/estimates-radio/ "Radiohead").  

But as I said, *what we love is culture, not products*. We don't to pay
for pieces of plastic anymore. Now that we have a mean to access content
for almost nothing, we don't see why intermediaries such as Sony and
Universal should get the lion's share of the profits instead of the
artists and the recording studios. In fact they should not even exist.


## How artists can get paid
I believe that *the best model for giving access to culture to consumers
is that of a global license*, where you pay a fixed amount every month
(say, $30) and you can download anything. The exchanges would be
monitored so that the most downloaded artists receive more money than
the others. The redistribution system could also be tweaked in favor of
smaller, unknown artists to support discovery.  

The above only concerns the content consumption at home, which has to be
cheap since high prices cannot compete with free alternatives. But *there
are alternative revenue streams for artists and the culture industry that cannot be copied or downloaded*. You cannot download a concert
experience, watching a movie in a theatre is a much more enjoyable than at home, you cannot print you own Metallica posters, and
so on. There is a huge amount of money here, more than enough to ensure
sustainable culture creation. In fact, *I think that mp3s and divxs
should be seen as marketing for these experiences*, which is why they
should be so cheap.  

So I'm not worried about artists, we will find a way to give them our
money, and encourage content creation. But the current model will soon
be dead, and [we should hasten its demise](http://ycombinator.com/rfs9.html "we should hasten its demise").
