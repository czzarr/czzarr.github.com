I've read a ton of posts about how tough it is to be an entrepreneur.
One works a lot, doesn't see friends, doesn't see his significant other
as much as one would want, basically lives for his idea, or maybe that's
how VCs would like you to live.
However, even when you don't give into these extremes which maybe worked
for a not-happy few, the average entrepeneur is not leading a normal
life. Entrepreneurship, and I mean real entrepreneurship, not selling
fucking socks online to your extended network of management consultant
friends, is crazy. It entails one person thinking she can change the
fucking world, with her bare hands. I mean what is wrong with that
person? Doesn't she realize she'll most likely be broke, alone and
crying rivers in 2 years' time? 

Most people don't understand that kind of choice. People want security,
they want a house for their offspring and a full stomach every
night. And really that's a pretty reasonable demand. However it usually
doesn't correlate with innovating and making progress for humanity as
far as technology is concerned.

My friends probably think I'm completely nuts. I'm just jumping in that
volcano, without any protection, and with a very feeble plan to get out
of it, let alone any plan B. And yet this is what I'm doing. I quit my
job, and started a freaking company, which I know won't make any
revenues before a long long time, and will fail if it doesn't attract
millions of users. Some would say I'm playing the lottery. But I'm not.

You see, before starting a company, I was dying slowly at a boring
dayjob. It taught me a lot about what I didn't want to do. Before that I
was playing poker online and was making 10x more than at my job. (don't
ask why I took the job). And before that I pretty much knocked it out of
the park in terms of academic credentials, going to a top 3 enginnering
school in France and getting an MS from Stanford.

However, I learned most of what I consider genuily useful and insightful
from my poker days. Poker made me fearless, it made me think about long
term, about positive expected value, it made me believe that you can get
really big even if you start with close to nothing.

Getting good at poker is hard work, a lot of dedicated time to studying
theory, regular opponents, patterns, but also, and most importantly, a
lot of work on yourself to prevent tilt. Tilt is the name poker players
give to the phenomenon that happens when one gets a few bad beats in a
row and loses it. Somehow one feels forgotten, unjustly punished by the
poker gods and starts playing as though one is due for some good run of
cards. It usually ends up pretty badly. Self control however is the key
to moving up in stakes and being succesful at online poker.

However, one thing I noticed is that the best players do tilt. The ones
who win the most don't tilt, but the very best, the smartest, the most
crazy good players do tilt. However they don't tilt for the same reasons
as us mere mortals, or at least that is what I assume. First of all
these guys don't give a fuck about money. They're ready to lose it all,
to lose $500k in one night even if that is 90% of their net worth
because they 300% believe in their game, their edge and what
they're doing. They are unfathomably focused on outplaying their
opponent, not winning money. Somehow these players always end up
super rich. They end up going on killing sprees, annihilating
everyone that challenges them, because they focus on one thing:
the game. They don't care about PR, rakeback deals,
staking, how big their bankroll is at any given time. All they
care about is making the best play every single time, to the best
of their ability. That's how Tom 'durrrr' Dwan lost 5 millions in
a few days to Isildur1, some Scandic sicko who appeared at of
nowhere and suddenly started beating every top player on FTP. Tom
Dwan continued playing because he thought he had an edge. He
didn't care about the money or he would've stopped way sooner.
Nobody likes to lose a few millions in a matter of hours. But he
bounced back. Not in this match, not against Isildur1. But in some
other games. It's all about passion. If you want to be the best at
something, you need to dive into it without asking questions. Look
at Zuckerberg. He is all about Facebook. You never see a TC press
release where he is named as an investor in XYZ the next X for Y
with twist Z startup. He just plows away.
