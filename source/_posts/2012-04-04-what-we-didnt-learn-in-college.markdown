Albert Wenger is right: 
[we are woefully prepared for internet age job market](http://continuations.com/post/20112755144/students-are-woefully-prepared-for-internet-age-job). 
The three of us graduated in Computer Science in college, we have had there a solid
engineering formation. But during the
numerous courses we took we never heard of [Github](http://github.com/) nor [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). 
People attending creative and artistic
formation don't hear of [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/) neither.

You could argue: What's the problem with that? You aren't supposed to learn
how to use these platforms in school but core skills in your field!

Saying that you would miss a point. The formation we all follow has one final
goal: be prepared to get the best job as possible. In our current
era finding a job doesn't come down to respond to job offers by sending
cover letters and resume nor spam by email all our contacts in the industry
to get an interview.  
We are lucky to live through the emergence and the 
expansion of specialized platforms which can help us build our personal
and professional identity. With these platforms we can easily have a
professional visibility, expose our skills so they can be assessed by
everyone and acquire real experience with real work. 

The very first recommendation we should receive beginning a course in
a topic is registering on all the platforms related to this topic. The
professors should foster us to leverage these platform to develop our
skills, build our expertise and gain some fame. Such platforms work this way: they play with
our ego to encourage us to contribute more and more and make our
achievements visible for everyone in return. They are built to be our showcase so
we should take advantage of it. 

So who is to blame for not teaching us this reality? Schools?
Professors? They should all keep up with the internet economy like they
usually keep up with the _real_ economy. I think schools should increase professors' awareness, who
are mainly researchers in engineering schools for example, to this
concern but it's up to the professors to promote personaly the right
platforms.
