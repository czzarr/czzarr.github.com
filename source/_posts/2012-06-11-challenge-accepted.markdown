Our book [Startup
Flow](http://leanpub.com/startupflow) is featured in this week's edition of *[Challenges](http://www.challenges.fr/)*, 
a French weekly newspaper dedicated to business and economy.  

*Challenges* says
the book is _"Ideal and time-saving for teams looking for the most productive workflow"_, which is
exactly what we had in mind when we wrote the book.

If you haven't read the book yet, [do it right
