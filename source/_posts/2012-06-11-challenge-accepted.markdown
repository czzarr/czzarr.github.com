We are happy to announce that [our book Startup
Flow](http://leanpub.com/startupflow) is featured on [Challenges](http://www.challenges.fr/), 
a french weekly newspaper dedicated to business and economy.  

The efforts we put in Startup Flow were praised by Challenges, saying
the book was _"Ideal and time-saving for teams looking for the most productive workflow"_. 

We expect the book to gain even more traction after such a featuring. If
you haven't read nor bought the book, [do it right
