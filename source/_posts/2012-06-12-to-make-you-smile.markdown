Fab celebrated this week [their first anniversary](http://betashop.com/post/24759506656/happy-fabiversary-1-year-of-fab) 
(since their pivot in fact, as [Fab was not an overnight success on day
 one](http://betashop.com/post/19456853116/fab-was-an-overnight-success-on-day-474)). 

Their growth is amazing: 4.75 members and +100 Millions in sales in just
one year. And it seems like it's just the beginning as they achieved to go into the mobile
sphere with solid anchors, mobile which is the biggest growth lever pointed out by all investors and 
creators. 

Mark Suster would say that they [flawlessly executed their business
model](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2012/05/23/its-morning-in-venture-capital/) but I'd 
say that their success comes from their [core beliefs](http://betashop.com/post/13607881842/10-ways-fab-is-building-a-different-type-of-company).

They _believe_ in a vision, in core principles they love to recall as
much as possible. This is even their first statements in their [Happy
Fabiversary blog post](http://betashop.com/post/24759506656/happy-fabiversary-1-year-of-fab). You can search for 
each of these belief in their blog to see how often they come back.  

Fab achieves to communicate such an energy in their belief that we can
feel theses principles behind every single line of text in their
website, behind every single quote from Jason Goldberg. Their gimmick
_To Make You Smile_ underlies all their decisions, choices: _Color is
very important, color makes people smile._ At Fab they have their core
principles and they stick to it: _We care more about making people smile
than making money from them_. 

Even if you could argue they do it just for communication purposes I
trully think they do it because they believe it. They communicate their
vision perfectly and make people adhere to it because they act like
gurus.

Choosing core values and placing every single decision the company makes
in the perspective of these values is what makes me smile.
