This week Fab celebrated [their first anniversary](http://betashop.com/post/24759506656/happy-fabiversary-1-year-of-fab) 
(since their pivot, as [Fab was not an overnight success on day
 one](http://betashop.com/post/19456853116/fab-was-an-overnight-success-on-day-474)). 

Their growth has been amazing: 4.75 M members and +100 M in sales in just
one year. And it seems like it's just the beginning as they've been successfully
conquering mobile users: 30% to 40% of Fabâ€™s daily visits are now via mobile. As mobile is the biggest
growth lever that an ecommerce company can have, these figures is a
good sign for the future Fab's sales.

How did they perform so well? Mark Suster would say that they [flawlessly executed their business
model](http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2012/05/23/its-morning-in-venture-capital/) but I'd 
go deeper in the reasons and say that their success comes from their [core beliefs
](http://betashop.com/post/13607881842/10-ways-fab-is-building-a-different-type-of-company) 
and the energy they put to broadcast them.

They _believe_ in a vision, in core principles they love to repeat as
much as possible. This is even their first statements in their [Happy
Fabiversary blog post](http://betashop.com/post/24759506656/happy-fabiversary-1-year-of-fab). You can search for 
each of these belief in their blog to see how often they come back. These values stand at 
the epicenter of their attitude and drive.

Fab communicates their beliefs with such a passion that we can
feel them behind every single line of text in their
website, behind every single quote from Jason Goldberg. Their gimmick
_To Make You Smile_ underlies all their decisions and choices: _Color is
very important, color makes people smile._ At Fab they have their core
principles and they stick to it: _We care more about making people smile
than making money from them_. 

Even if one could argue that they do it just for marketing purposes I
truly think they do it because they uphold totally their core beliefs. They communicate their
vision perfectly and make people adhere to it because they act like
passionate leaders.

Choosing core values and placing every single decision the company makes
in the perspective of these values is what makes me smile.
