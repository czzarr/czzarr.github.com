Today on Hacker News I came across this 
[article of the Inc. Magazine](http://www.inc.com/magazine/201205/burt-helm/turntable-founders-sxsw-where-did-our-love-go.html). Article seemed very interesting, talking about
[Turntable.fm](http://turntable.fm). It had been a while since I hadn't read about Turnable.fm, 
I am a big fan of all kind of collaborative experiences on the web, 
author made efficient linkbaiting for its title (?? COmment on dit ). 
In brief, I was really enthustiastic to read this article.  


The first thing I do when I come to a new page is to check the length of
the article. _How long will it take me to read this article?_ This one
made me wince: a very long article paginated in 4 long pages. Two things
scared me: pagination and length.  

Pagination because I had the
impression being on Google looking for something and having to go to
page 4 to comb deeply. Length because this article was not the only one
I planned to read. I'm not a time magician, there is still work
waiting for me to be done and I can't spend my time being a 
[passive reader](http://needforair.com/blog/2012/04/27/capitalize-on-what-you-read/).

I told myself _Ok, I'm not comfortable with this article but I will
force myself to go till the end because that's something really
interesting_. That's how it began. I read the first page without
skipping a line then began the second page. But I couldn't do it.
The article was too long. Way too long. Not boring but inappropriately long for what I expected. 
How did it end? I skipped most of the article, read some random
statements to grasp the main ideas. I'm not proud of myself as I really
wanted to get more involved in the subject but 
[I'm a nutcracker](http://needforair.com/blog/2012/03/26/we-are-all-nutcrackers/).

I don't think I am the only in this situation. That's why I really think
there is still some flaws with these long articles. They are what makes
the web interesting to browse, they bring a lot of value but their entry
barrier is too high. Please authors, make it shorter or make the gist of
your article easily comprehensible.
