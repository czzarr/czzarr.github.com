The other day on Hacker News I came across this 
[article of the Inc. Magazine](http://www.inc.com/magazine/201205/burt-helm/turntable-founders-sxsw-where-did-our-love-go.html). Article seemed very interesting, talking about
[Turntable.fm](http://turntable.fm). It had been a while since I hadn't read about Turnable.fm, 
all news about collaborative experiences on the web excites me, 
the title was linkbaity: the article looked interesting to me.


The first thing I do when I come to a new page is to check the length of
the article. _How long will it take me to read this article?_ This one
made me wince: a very long article paginated in 4 long pages. Two things
scared me: pagination and length.  

First I don't like pagination on news website. I have the
impression being on Google looking for something and having to go to
page 4 to find something interesting. Length because this article was not the only one
I planned to read. My time is not extensible, there is still work
waiting for me to be done and I can't spend my time being a 
[passive reader](http://needforair.com/blog/2012/04/27/capitalize-on-what-you-read/).

I told myself _Ok, I'm not comfortable with this article but I will
force myself to go till the end because that's something really
intriguing_. That's how it began. I read the first page without
skipping a line then began the second page. But I couldn't do it.
The article was too long. Way too long. Not boring but inappropriately long for what I expected. 
How did it end? I skipped most of the article, read some random
statements to grasp the main ideas. I'm not proud of myself as I really
wanted to get more involved in the subject but 
[I'm a nutcracker](http://needforair.com/blog/2012/03/26/we-are-all-nutcrackers/).

I don't think I am the only one in this situation. I _really_ like reading,
documenting myself but I can't always make it with theses long articles. They are what makes
the web interesting to browse, they bring a lot of value but their entry
barrier is too high but they don't fit for every reading time. We could
really lower the barrier to these articles, make them more digestible by 
summarizing their gist.
