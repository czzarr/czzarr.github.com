*This is the first post of a serie of brainteasers. Principle is simple: 
A little of wording and a question. Answer goes in the comments.
Quickiest good one win the prize. The difficulty will adapt according to the answers. Have
fun.*


2140' Worldwide Catch Tournament. 6 participants from the 6 continents
on earth (WTF!) confront one another for the title of Master Catcher on Earth.
The tournament proceeds in 6 rounds. At each round each participant
meets the 7 others challengers. Leaderboard's computation is easy: 1 point
for one victory. As you may know there is no draw in Catch.  

3 months before the end of the Tournament here's the leaderboard and the
remaining matches.


| Participants | Score | | Louis | Stan | Charles | Bea| Bruno | Kilian|
|---------|-----|-----|-----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Louis the Butcher| 15|    |    | 3  | 2  | 4  | 2  | 4 |
| Stan the Killer| 14 |     |3   |    | 2  | 4  | 2  | 4 |
| Charles the CapsLocker |  |3   | 3  |    | 4  | 2  | 4 | 
| Bea the Tonifier | 12|    |3   | 3  | 2  |    | 2  | 4 |

| Kilian the Petit-Pois|8|  |3   | 3  | 2  | 4  | 2  |   |

Who can still pretend to be Master Catche on Earth ?
