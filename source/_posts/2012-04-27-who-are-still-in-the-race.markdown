*This is an advanced brainteaser which requires some algorithmic knowledge. Principle is simple: 
A little of wording and a question. Answer goes in the comments. Have
fun.*


Worldwide Catch Tournament. 1 contestant from each continent
on earth confront one another for the title of Master Catcher on Earth.
The tournament proceeds in 6 rounds. At each round each participant
meets the 7 others challengers. Scoring is easy: 1 point/victory. As you may know there is no draw in Catch.  

3 months before the end of the Tournament here's the scoreboard and the
number of remaining matches between the contestants.


| Participants | Score | - | Louis | Stan | Charles | Olivier| Bruno | Kilian|
|:-------------|------|-----|-----|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Louis the Butcher       | 11 |   |    | 3  | 3  | 2  | 2  | 3 
| Stan the Dawg           | 10 |   |3   |    | 4  | 3  | 3  | 2 
| Charles the CapsLocker  | 6  |   |3   | 4  |    | 4  | 3  | 2  
| Olivier the Magician    | 7  |   |2   | 3  | 4  |    | 3  | 3 
| Bruno the Captain       | 8  |   |2   | 3  | 3  | 3  |    | 3 
| Kilian the Petit-Pois   |5   |   |3   | 2  | 2  | 3  | 3  |

Who can still pretend to be Master Catcher on Earth ?

As you can easily find a solution by hand it'll be nice if you could
propose a scalable algorithmic solution to this problem (what if you had +100
participants?).
