The future of search engines has recently been [discussed](http://rogerandmike.com/post/13133644688/10-hypotheses-for-technology-investing) [at](http://continuations.com/post/18605081084/bringing-time-back-to-the-web-or-the-struggle-for) [length](http://also.roybahat.com/post/19307918051/bd-is-the-new-seo).
Admittedly the major shift from computers to mobile devices and the
global pervasion of social media into everyone's behavior do not bode
well for search. I think this is not a good indicator though, and that
the problem isn't inherent to search.

## Mobile Search User Experience Sucks

Searching on smartphones is currently a terrible user experience. Screens are
tiny, typos frequent, missclicks incredibly annoying. Search results
don't account well for the fact that smartphones are not simply smaller versions of
computers.

I think that's why social media have been winning so far on mobile
devices. Discovering content and generally browsing social media apps
such as Facebook's is a much more enjoyable and user-friendly experience
than searching for content. When UX sucks to the point that it's too
inconvenient, people don't use the product.

Can you remember when you still had Windows? Looking for a file was
absurdly hard and difficult, borderline impossible. That's why most
people just used their brain to remember where they put their files on
their hard drive, and went looking for it by opening folder after
folder, eventhough they using Google for looking for stuff on the web.
And yet that was a regression from the days when there was no graphical
interface.

## Enters Siri 

A lot of people say it's a gadget, it's not actionable,
it's an Apple marketing ploy to sell you an iPhone 4 at a 20% premium. I
think however that it's much more than that and that these critics are
missing the elephant in the room. For me, Siri is the new
shell. 

For those that don't know what a shell is, it's a command-line
interface to your computer's operating system that enables you to tell
your computer to do things (like copy/paste files, move them, delete
them, or... **search** for them) instead of doing them yourself with
your mouse. The shell is a great interface for search inside your
computer. Finding files by name or content is easy. Most people never
knew it existed because Windows just hid it from every non tech-savvy
user out there, for whatever reason.

But think about what Siri does. You ask her to set your
alarm, to give you the weather, to find a restaurant. Basically, it's a
vocal recognition-enabled shell. And eventhough it's still rough on the
edges, I'm positive it's going to become much more powerful in the near
future. Basically, Siri is going to bring search back to mobile devices,
as it is a great UX to search on smartphones.


## Search will never die

In fact, search is actually [blowing up](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3770958). [DuckDuckGo](http://duckduckgo.com)
is a new search engine that differentiates itself from Google and the
others by respecting your privacy, among other things. This is their
killer feature on paper. But more interesting I think is the fact that
the growth shot up right after its visual refresh. The homepage is now as simple as the Google homepage used to be.
There is only a search box and a logo. No clutter, no toolbar, no
nothing. This is arguably the best desktop
UX for search. On the other hand, the google homepage is looking more
and more like a 1990's portal...

On a higher level, I want to ask: how could search die? Are
people suddenly going to stop looking for stuff online? How could that
be? People are always going to need or want to search. It cannot die.
Only a certain UX can die. I think new search engines are going to
differentiate themselves by the content they index (like
[teleportd's](http://teleportd.com) for user-uploaded photos) or a
radically contrarian positionning like duckduckgo's.

Long live search engines.
