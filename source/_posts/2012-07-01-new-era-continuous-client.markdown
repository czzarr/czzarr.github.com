At Google I/O there were [many interesting announcements](http://www.businessinsider.com/google-io-product-announcements-2012-6?op=1): [Nexus 7](http://gigaom.com/mobile/nexus-7-first-look-its-here-to-snuff-kindles-fire/), Google
Glass, etc. (Perhaps too many as one can say that [Google is fighting too
many ennemies on too many fronts](http://gigaom.com/2012/06/27/google-vs-everyone/)). 
One news that drew my attention is the arrival of Google Chrome on iOs. [Don't expect the change is browsing
experience](http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/28/hands-on-with-googles-chrome-for-ios-just-like-chrome-for-android-only-slower/)
you could have had on your desktop as this app is merely a graphical
layer on top of Apple's WebView from its SDK. Basically the engine is the same as Safari ...
just slower. 

But that's not my point. I prefer to talk about the sync functionnality
that Google Chrome on iOS offers: by activating the sync on your
different devices (desktop, iPad, iPhone...) you can open a tab you were
viewing in one device on another one. The [Continous Client](http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/26/a-modest-proposal-the-continuous-client/) becomes real.

>So what is a Continuous Client you ask? Well the premise is simple: when you leave one device, you pick up your session in exactly the same place on the next device you use. Meaning your IM, Twitter, web browsing, applications, even your windows appear just as they did on the previous device. The situation I describe above would be obviated by this setup, allowing me to move from my laptop to iPad in a seamless manner which would in no way disrupt the activity I was currently engaged in. [...] Put simply, you are placeshifting your computing experience from one device to the next with no break in your work, timelines, or conversations.

After using the cloud to [store persistent data easily](https://www.dropbox.com/) and
[seamlessly](https://www.icloud.com/),
one can now use it as a relay to keep a continuity in the browsing experience 
between different devices.

We can however imagine various implementations of the continuous client to enhance our global user experience.
For example, [Invoxia](http://www.invoxia.com/en/) with its business dock adopts the same
vision for phone by bridging mobile and office calls.

My experience of these two continous clients is so magic but nonetheless so
natural that I'm looking forward of future ones startups or existing
companies will invent to make our everyday life even more
pleasant and interruptions-free. 

And you, do you know another usecase where a continuous client architecture is
already available?
