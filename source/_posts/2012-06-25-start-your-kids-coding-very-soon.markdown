On [Fred Destin's](http://freddestin.com/fred) initiative, the big stars
at [Founders Forum](http://foundersforum.eu/), including Niklas ZennStr√∂m
(Skype), Chad Hurley (Youtube) and many others, shoted last week a funny
and viral video to promote [CodeClub](http://www.codeclub.org.uk/).
CodeClub is a brilliant action which tends to _Inspire kids to learn
code and Create a nationwide after school coding club for children aged 10-11_.

Kids are the future, everybody knows it. Coding is too. When we see what
our generation's genius made and how they revolutionized our world
whereas computer science and coding were at their premise , one
can't do anything but promote the next generation to dive into code as
soon as possible. 

Supporting this initiative is supporting a long term vision for our
economy and our education system. There is no day without reading that
there is a big lack of great programmers, that [data-scientist is the
hottest job at this time](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/060412-data-scientist-259697.html) 
or that [learning to code is a great move](http://www.elezea.com/2012/04/programming-and-thinking/). 
So we should foster our kids to embrace this activity as soon as
possible. 

The more we learn something early the better we are good at it and the
less we are adverse to it. We belong to a generation where there is
still a big proportion of people who are not at ease with computers or
smartphones. Even an entreprising friend of mine judges that it's too
late for him to learn code whereas he's only 25! But have you
experienced [kids change of behaviour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXV-yaFmQNk) toward our world? 
I don't think there will be many kids in 10 years who won't know how to
use a smartphone. And I do want to think that these kids in 10 years won't
be as reluctant to learn code as people can be today. Perhaps the
qualifiers _geeky_ or _nerd_ won't exist anymore, or have a very distant meaning,
who knows ?
