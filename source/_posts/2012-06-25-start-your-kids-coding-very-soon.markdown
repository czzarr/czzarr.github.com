On [Fred Destin's initiative](http://freddestin.com/2012/06/get-your-kid-coding-with-codeclub-with-free-viral-video.html), the big stars
at [Founders Forum](http://foundersforum.eu/), including Niklas ZennStr√∂m
(Skype), Chad Hurley (Youtube) and many others, shooted last week a funny
and viral video to promote [CodeClub](http://www.codeclub.org.uk/).
CodeClub is a brilliant action which aims at _inspiring kids to learn
code and creating a nationwide after school coding club for children aged 10-11_.

Kids are the future, everybody knows it. Computer are, too. When we see what
our generation's geniuses made and how they revolutionized our world
when computer science and coding were at their premises, one
can only urge the next generation to dive into code as
soon as possible. 

Supporting this initiative is supporting a long term vision for our
economy and our education system. There is no day without reading that
there is a big lack of great programmers, that [data-scientist is the
hottest job at this time](http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/060412-data-scientist-259697.html) 
or that [learning to code is a great move](http://www.elezea.com/2012/04/programming-and-thinking/). 
So we should foster our kids to embrace this activity as soon as
possible as informatics, hardware will be everywhere. By extending the base
of people having the skills to program we foster the future innovation.

The earlier we start learning something the better we are good at it and the
less we fear it. We belong to a generation where there is
still a big proportion of people who are not at ease with computers or
smartphones. Even an entreprising friend of mine judges that it's too
late for him to start learning how to code whereas he's only 25! But have you
experienced [kids change of behaviour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXV-yaFmQNk) towards our world? 
I don't think there will be many kids in 10 years who won't know how to
use a smartphone. And I do want to think that these kids in 10 years won't
be as reluctant to learn code as people can be today. Perhaps the
qualifiers _geeky_ or _nerd_ won't exist anymore, or have a very distant meaning, 
commensurate to what these people have created by now.
Who knows ?
