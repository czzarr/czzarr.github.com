## We are still alive!
You may have noticed, but we have been pretty silent lately, our last
blogpost dates back to November 14th and announced our Chrome extension.
As you can imagine, we were pretty busy working on
[tldr.io](http://tldr.io) and didn't have enough time to maintain this
blog. Lots of crazy stuff happened: we won
[Seedcamp](http://seedcamp.com), we built a lot of new features
including a brand new Chrome extension with which you can contribute and
our community is growing faster than ever.

## What's next?
We have decided to start blogging again, but as tldr.io and not
NeedForAir anymore. We'll use this [new blog](http://blog.tldr.io) to
keep you updated about tldr.io feature releases, news and we'll also
blog about technical stuff.

<a target="_blank" href="http://blog.tldr.io" style="padding:25px;background:#008CD4;display:block;width:200px;margin:30px auto 0px auto;font-size:22px;font-family:CassanetBold, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica,border-radius:5px;color:white;border-radius:5px; text-align: center;">Go read the tldr.io blog</a>

## We won't kill this blog though
There are still a lot of people coming to this blog (mainly from
Google), so we won't shut it down. If you liked what you found here, be
sure to check [the tldr.io blog](http://blog.tldr.io) out! And to wrap NeedForAir up, here are the five most-read articles:
