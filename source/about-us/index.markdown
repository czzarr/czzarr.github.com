[Need for Air](https://twitter.com/#!/NeedForAir) is composed of Louis Chatriot, Stanislas Marion and Charles Miglietti. Sharing the same passion for the internet and entrepreneurship, we quit our day jobs at the same time to launch a company together. We are working on making good content more easily discoverable through better curation. Previously we learned to work together on an interactive ebook we made with Captain Dash for the French Employers' Association.

I'm a long-time geek who's always wanted to understand how things work, especially in the fields of math, physics, computer science and economy.

After 6 months as software engineer at Robinsons Participations about 2 years as a consultant for Bain & Company, I finally decided it was time to launch my own company, with Charles and Stan.


I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique (majored in CS) and have a MS in Management Science and Engineering from Stanford University.

I've been meaning to start a company for a long time. I quit my job
without a firm idea nor a cofounder. It didn't take long to find both.
In the past I successfully played online poker at middle to high stakes, which taught me a
lot about risk-taking, long-term focus and short term swings, adapting
and the value of money.

I worked for about 2 years at a [Parisian startup](http://yseop.com), where
I learned a ton about small team dynamics and problems.
I graduated from Ecole Centrale Paris and have an MS in Management Science and Engineering from Stanford University.

I have recently graduated in CS. I chose CS and Maths because that's
here where the added value is in college for me. It gives you the power
to create and innovate. I love being self driven by my motivation and my
ideas. I am a passionate reader who loves to think up, build new things.  

My credo is to capitalize as much as possible on my everyday work and I
am sure I'm not the only one. I'm a huge fan of collaborative
initiatives and I truly think they are still rare and not mainstream. In
my attempt to build synergies I think there are still individual efforts
that are repeated by hundreds, thousands of people and that can be handled
collaboratively. I am really convinced that we can build new efficient solutions that
take advantage of the Internet as a network layer to organize the power of the crowd.
