[Need for Air](https://twitter.com/#!/NeedForAir) is composed of Charles Miglietti, Louis Chatriot and Stanislas Marion. 
Sharing the same passion for the internet and calling for entrepreneurship, we quit our day jobs at the same time 
to embrace change and decided to launch a company together. We are working on making 
good content more easily discoverable through better curation.
Previously we learned to work together on our first (and only so far) freelance mission for
[Laurence Parisot](https://twitter.com/#!/laurenceparisot) and the [Medef](http://www.medef.com/medef-corporate.html).

I am an avid learner and I like to get really good at what I'm doing. 
I went from Legos to video games to PHP to chess to math to online poker and back to computer science.
Successfully playing online poker professionally at middle to high stakes taught me a
lot about risk-taking, long-term focus and short term swings, adapting
and the value of money.

After working for 1.5 years at a [Parisian startup](http://yseop.com), I decided to make the jump and launch mine, with Charles and Louis.
I graduated from Ecole Centrale Paris and have an MS in Management Science and Engineering from Stanford University.

I do what I love and I'm always on the lookout for a good challenge. Being passionate about computer science and math,
as well as innovation,I became more and more interested in entrepreneurship.

After graduating from Ecole Polytechnique, I spent a year as an embedded systems engineer at [Withings](http://withings.com), 
one of the most promising French startups at the moment. Inspired by this experience, I decided to quit to start my own company.

I'm a long-time geek who's always wanted to understand how things work, especially in the fields of math, physics, computer science and economy.

After 6 months as software engineer at Robinsons Participations and 1.5 year as a consultant for Bain & Company, I finally decided it was time to launch my own company, with Charles and Stan.

I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique (majored in CS) and have a MS in Management Science and Engineering from Stanford University.
