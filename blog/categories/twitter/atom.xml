    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook notifications, Twitter feeds, RSS feeds, emails, news
aggregators and now so much
more. We are constantly hit by new information, throughout the day, and
the night. There are so many things we want to read or watch.
The fact that the Web is a strictly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a> application (or should I say
<a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-02-13-an-api-ontology">Hypermedia</a>) doesn't help because one link usually leads to more links. I'm sure
you've already experienced having more than 20 tabs open in your browser
and thinking "<em>God, when am I going to read all of this?</em>" but instead
of starting reading you scan the links of the page in front of you and
just open more tabs. And this was only made worse by tools such as
<a href="http://instapaper.com" title="Instapaper">Instapaper</a> that make you feel good
about saving stuff for later, even if you know deep inside you'll never
come back to it.</p>

<h2>Current solutions</h2>

<p>It's extremely hard to keep up with all that information, and you
basically have 3 options at the moment:</p>

<h4>Let loose</h4>

<p>Accept that you can't follow it all and if something is really important
it will come back to you one way or another so that missing it the first
time is not a big deal.
I personnally don't like this solution because it means giving up
control on what I read and learn, and it basically amounts to a random
filter with some bias towards the most important news that isn't always
the most interesting.</p>

<h4>Algorithmic filters</h4>

<p>Use tools such as <a href="http://news.me" title="News.me">News.me</a> or <a href="http://focus.io" title="Focus.io">Focus.io</a> that
use machine learning techniques to serve you the stories you might be
interested in the most. However, again, not knowing how these algorithms
work exactly, I fear I am going to lose the serendipity of scanning
myself all the input and selecting the hidden little gem that would be
considered as noise by these algorithms. Again, I hate losing control. I
do think these are better solutions than just letting loose.</p>

<h4>Reducing the input</h4>

<p>This for me is the best alternative. Following sort of a <em>less is more</em> convention,
I am looking to reduce the number of sources rather than increasing it,
keeping only the outstanding ones. I am constantly reevaluating the
quality of the twitter accounts and bloggers I follow in order to remove
those that either tweet too much  or whose content quality has suffered.
I am very rarely looking for new people to follow, and when I try
someone new it is always an experiment, never set in stone. I'd actually
like it if an algorithm could do that for me, again, not knowing the
inner workings of the services that offer news recommendation is too
bad. I'm willing to bet none of them though is going to unfollow someone
on twitter for you, or experiment with a new follower, based on the
quality of the links provided in the tweets. Same for RSS feeds.</p>

<h2>We need a new tool to find good content</h2>

<p>Basically none of today's tools are good at finding good news and
information. You can use a combination of tools (such as <a href="http://quora.com" title="Quora">Quora</a> and <a href="http://stackexchange.com" title="StackEchange">StackExchange</a> but it is more
difficult than one tool and is conducive to a lot of noise. Plus we are
missing a linking tool between content of the same nature and topics,
that would transcend time. There are services like <a href="http://delicious.com" title="Delicious">Delicious</a> that you
can browse by searching for tags, but it is not powerful enough in the
way it presents the information. There are still too many links and not
enough clues as to which are interesting and which are not.</p>

<p>But don't worry, we're working on it ;)</p>
