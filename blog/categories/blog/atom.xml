    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>We are still alive!</h2>

<p>You may have noticed, we have been pretty silent lately. Our last
blogpost dates back to November 14th when we announced the first release of our Chrome extension.
As you can imagine, we were pretty busy working on
<a href="http://tldr.io">tldr.io</a> and didn't have enough time to maintain this
blog. Lots of crazy stuff happened: we won
<a href="http://www.seedcamp.com/2012/12/a-worthy-finish-to-2012-seedcamp-paris.html">Seedcamp Paris</a>, we built a lot of new features
including a brand new Chrome extension with which you can read or contribute the summary of any web page and
our community is growing faster than ever.</p>

<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>We have decided to start blogging again, but as tldr.io and not
NeedForAir anymore. We'll use this <a href="http://blog.tldr.io">new blog</a> to
keep you updated about tldr.io feature releases, best content and we'll also
blog about engineering and entrepreneurial challenges.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://blog.tldr.io" style="padding:25px;background:#008CD4;display:block;width:200px;margin:30px auto 0px auto;font-size:22px;font-family:CassanetBold, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica,border-radius:5px;color:white;border-radius:5px; text-align: center;">Go read the tldr.io blog</a></p>

<h2>We won't kill NeedForAir though</h2>

<p>There are still a lot of people coming to this blog (mainly from
search) for the tutorials we posted, so we won't shut it down. If you liked what you found here, be
sure to check <a href="http://blog.tldr.io">the tldr.io blog</a> out and update your RSS subscription! And to wrap NeedForAir up, here are the five most-read articles:</p>
