    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>In a nutshell...</em> Have you never been looking for this expression
while reading an article? The fact is that we are all fond of digested
information. With Internet and social medias the quantity of information
one has access to has become huge; we are coping with an
<a href="http://needforair.com/information-overload-and-how-to-keep-up-with-5849" title="Overload">information overload problem</a>.
We can potentially be aware of everything that is going on everywhere, instantaneously
and regarding any topic. <strong>In this context, the demand for digested
information is growing tremendously.</strong><br/>
Recently, many startups have been leveraging that fondness to
succeed. <a href="http://www.fanbridge.com/" title="Fanbridge">Franbridge</a> with its
<a href="http://www.fanbridge.com/blog/introducing-social-digest" title="Social Digest">Social digest</a>
will soon reach <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/03/21/as-it-turns-out-fanbridges-most-exciting-product-is-boring-old-email/">10 millions subscribers</a>!<br/>
Why people do love and value digested information so much?</p>

<h2>Digested information is our natural representation of information</h2>

<p>We all love digested information because it makes the information easy
to grasp.
It is very popular because it replicates the mental
process we do when reading. We look for headlines, bold text, headers,
we scan the text to form our overall picture of the content. Digested
information gathers all those clues and eases this process.<br/>
Part of this cognitive process is the memorisation. Digested information
makes memorisation more accessible. Remember those cheatsheets you
religiously wrote down for your exam preparation in college? Reading the digest of an
article has the same effect. When building our personal knowledge
database we store those keywords, key sentences. Digested information is
the natural form of information our brain manipulates when it internally
classifies, archives, queries our memory.</p>

<h2>Digested information piques reader's curiosity</h2>

<p>While reading we like it when the content arouses our curiosity. I would even say
that we expect an article to <em>catch</em> us. Digested information provides
the gist that drives us to the dive in the details. It avoids the wall of text effect and
stimulates our willingness to dig further into subject. It's like reading gossips! You
get hooked and then you want to know more about it.</p>

<p>Digested information is a very valuable resource and its era should come soon.</p>

    <updated>2012-03-21T12:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://needforair.com/blog/2012/03/21/why-we-write-digests-of-interesting-content</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>All three of us read a lot. Blogs, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" title="Hacker News">Hacker News</a>, links we get through
Twitter, etc. Browsing dozens of articles a week to stay informed is great but do we get the most out of it? <strong>Do we
actually memorize the gist of all that content we are reading?</strong> Spending
so much time reading would be a huge waste if it wasn't consolidated in
some fashion. That's why we decided to write summaries of the best
articles we find.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/60546721@N00/102673733/"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/42/102673733_39cbb51495_n.jpg" alt="Keep the gist" /></a>

<h2>It forces you to really understand what the article is about</h2>

<p>My Math and Physics professors would always say that the best way to learn
was to get to the point where you are able to
<strong>recap the course materials in writing</strong> (theroems, proofs, case studies).</p>

<p>In order to select the most critical parts of an article you need to
really read through the whole article and pick up the signal that you
want to remember. This means you should understand thoroughly what the
article is about and the author's reasoning. Why she spent time on some
subject and not on others.</p>

<p>When writing up a summary, be it by mere copy/pasting or rephrasing, you put yourself
in an active cognitive process. You are not simply consuming
anymore, you are disecting and structuring information. Not only will
your memory be more deeply impressed than if you just read but it will
be more structured and organized.</p>

<h2>You can go back to it later</h2>

<p>Bookmarking is currently the only way of organizing and keeping up with the content that you
loved and that you would want to be able to find again later and share
to others via tools such as <a href="http://delicious.com" title="Delicious">Delicious</a>,
or <a href="http://pinboard.in" title="Pinboard">Pinboard</a>.
However you still need to reread the whole article once you go back to
it, which can be a waste of time in some cases. <a href="http://evernote.com" title="Evernote">Evernote</a> is better in that regard as
you make save notes on any topic.</p>

<p><strong>If you had summaries for each of your bookmarks</strong>, you could go back to
that content and filter it in a much more effective fashion, deciding
whether or not you want to delve into the whole article or not. It is
something between the title and the article that is missing to help you
filter through your bookmarks and consume your content.</p>

<p>We keep all of our digests in an organized way so that they are easily
searchable and consumable.</p>

<h2>Sharing becomes easier</h2>

<p>Digests also make it easier to share content. Ever tried to send a link
to someone, and never got any feedback? Chances are they
are receiving hundreds of links per day, by email, facebook, twitter, etc.
You're asking that person for too much work. She doesn't have enough time
to read yet another whole article without knowing it's high quality content.</p>

<p><strong>If you include a short digest</strong> of the article or video or podcast in your
email, you can be sure there is a much higher chance that she reads the
digest and eventually clicks the link, intrigued. And you'll be
able to have a conversation about it. That is sharing. Sending naked links is not sharing,
it's spamming.</p>

    <link href="http://needforair.com/blog/2012/03/09/how-to-keep-up-with-the-information-overload/"/>
    <updated>2012-03-09T12:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://needforair.com/blog/2012/03/09/how-to-keep-up-with-the-information-overload</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook notifications, Twitter feeds, RSS feeds, emails, news
aggregators and now so much
more. We are constantly hit by new information, throughout the day, and
the night. There are so many things we want to read or watch.
The fact that the Web is a strictly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a> application (or should I say
<a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-02-13-an-api-ontology">Hypermedia</a>) doesn't help because one link usually leads to more links. I'm sure
you've already experienced having more than 20 tabs open in your browser
and thinking "<em>God, when am I going to read all of this?</em>" but instead
of starting reading you scan the links of the page in front of you and
just open more tabs. And this was only made worse by tools such as
<a href="http://instapaper.com" title="Instapaper">Instapaper</a> that make you feel good
about saving stuff for later, even if you know deep inside you'll never
come back to it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/martinofranchi/2925760927/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3244/2925760927_a9db10926e_m.jpg" alt="Information overload" /></a></p>

<h2>Current solutions</h2>

<p>It's extremely hard to keep up with all that information, and you
basically have 3 options at the moment:</p>

<h4>Let loose</h4>

<p>Accept that you can't follow it all and if something is really important
it will come back to you one way or another so that missing it the first
time is not a big deal.
I personnally don't like this solution because it means giving up
control on what I read and learn, and it basically amounts to a random
filter with some bias towards the most important news that isn't always
the most interesting.</p>

<h4>Algorithmic filters</h4>

<p>Use tools such as <a href="http://news.me" title="News.me">News.me</a> or <a href="http://focus.io" title="Focus.io">Focus.io</a> that
use machine learning techniques to serve you the stories you might be
interested in the most. However, again, not knowing how these algorithms
work exactly, I fear I am going to lose the serendipity of scanning
myself all the input and selecting the hidden little gem that would be
considered as noise by these algorithms. Again, I hate losing control. I
do think these are better solutions than just letting loose.</p>

<h4>Reducing the input</h4>

<p>This for me is the best alternative. Following sort of a <em>less is more</em> convention,
I am looking to reduce the number of sources rather than increasing it,
keeping only the outstanding ones. I am constantly reevaluating the
quality of the twitter accounts and bloggers I follow in order to remove
those that either tweet too much  or whose content quality has suffered.
I am very rarely looking for new people to follow, and when I try
someone new it is always an experiment, never set in stone. I'd actually
like it if an algorithm could do that for me, again, not knowing the
inner workings of the services that offer news recommendation is too
bad. I'm willing to bet none of them though is going to unfollow someone
on twitter for you, or experiment with a new follower, based on the
quality of the links provided in the tweets. Same for RSS feeds.</p>

<h2>We need a new tool to find good content</h2>

<p>Basically none of today's tools are good at finding good news and
information. You can use a combination of tools (such as <a href="http://quora.com" title="Quora">Quora</a> and <a href="http://stackexchange.com" title="StackEchange">StackExchange</a> but it is more
difficult than one tool and is conducive to a lot of noise. Plus we are
missing a linking tool between content of the same nature and topics,
that would transcend time. There are services like <a href="http://delicious.com" title="Delicious">Delicious</a> that you
can browse by searching for tags, but it is not powerful enough in the
way it presents the information. There are still too many links and not
enough clues as to which are interesting and which are not.</p>

<p>But don't worry, we're working on it ;)</p>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nireyal">@nireyal</a> - Feb 26, 2012</em></p>

<p><em>Nir Eyal describes the importance of habits besides virality for the
success of products in the Curated Web</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Habits are what matters. Web businesses success increasingly depends on the strength of their users' habitual behavior</li>
<li>Web 1.0 companies measured success by pageviews and CPM, whereas new (social) companies proved  to be valuable because they were habit-forming (hot triggers, variable rewards, regular check-in...)</li>
<li>At the dawn of the Curated Web, companies must build habit creation into their products and business models. Not only are users inundated by distractions, but acquiring users is also harder than ever before</li>
<li>Companies which successfully create user habits can build huge enterprises, even without viral growth (Evernote, Amazon)</li>
<li>The more the user engages with a Curated Web company, the more data the company has to tailor and improve the user&rsquo;s experience. This self-improving feedback loop has the potential to be more useful &ndash; and more addictive &mdash; than anything we&rsquo;ve seen before</li>

<p><em>Josh Constine reports the move of Facebook Analytics Tool Insights to
Real Time and describes all the possibilities it will enable</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Page performance data in (near) real-time rather than on average 48 hour delay could enable businesses to reach higher ROIs</li>
<li>Immediate &ldquo;people talking about this&rdquo; data could give marketers a sense of a post&rsquo;s virality, and indicate if they should modify the content or the apps they link to</li>
<li>&ldquo;Insights API give Page owners an opportunity to see how their Page actually lives and breathes&rdquo;.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s up to us as tool developers to turn that data into something awesome and present it in relevant actionable analytics.&rdquo;</li>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jordankurzweil">@JordanKurzweil</a> - Feb 25, 2012</em></p>

<p><em>Jordan Kurzweil describes the context of &ldquo;digital magazination&rdquo; of content. He states some recommendations to straighten up print business. At the heart of his reflexion is personalized and curated content</em></p>

<ul>
<li>PRINT IS DEAD. revenue, subscriptions and circulation are declining</li>
<li>What can Old Print do to survive? Stop rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, grow a pair, and change your business model:

<ul>
<li>Accept this evolution (aging and fragmentation of audience, concurrency from other digital media ...) and embrace it</li>
<li>Start thinking like startups: use some of your profits to incubate new ideas (e.g. Washington post personalized headlines)</li>
<li>Rethink your organization : everyone should be a doer, contributing 100 percent of her/his work hours to making things</li>
<li>Stop thinking that technology serves content: they are now one and the same, each working with the other to delight and engage your users</li>
<li>Update web platforms</li>
<li>Use data to inform your editorial and product decisions</li>
<li>Break down the wall between editors, writers and readers</li>
<li>Consider your content as a currency, not the end-all be-all but a means to an end</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
