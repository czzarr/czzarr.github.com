    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I <a href="http://needforair.com/blog/2012/04/04/what-we-didnt-learn-in-college/">already wrote</a> about how
you can leverage some <a href="https://github.com/">social platforms</a> to build
your visibility on the internet, but they offer much more.
They provide appropriate tools that help people to be more productive
and better organized. They are much more functional than pure social networks
and even more valuable as the communities are active.</p>

<p><img src="http://cardview.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/nation-builder.jpg" height="220" alt="Keep the gist" /></p>

<h2>Platforms structure communities</h2>

<p>We can call such a platform a <em>community organizing platform</em> because
it allows a community to have a place to gather, discuss and share. It
provides the global structure the community needs to get organized.
Ten years ago the forums laid the foundation but today these platforms
achieve what's been initiated.</p>

<p>Using these platforms everyone creates and manages a business card that
is accessible by everyone else.
People can easily be identified, followed, consulted and appraised. You
don't have to go to as many conferences or events to meet new people
because it can be done very efficiently online.</p>

<h2>Community organizing platforms offer more than pure social networks</h2>

<p>Pure social networks like Twitter offer ways to
organize communities but don't provide the structure
and tools needed for effective collaboration. They are mainly focus on
sharing.</p>

<p>While community organizing platforms provide a social layer they
also offer services geared towards the community itself. This
combination is what's really valuable.
<a href="http://nationbuilder.com/">Nation Builder</a>
is the perfect example: it features volunteer organization, donation
monitoring, website creation... a comprehensive package
political leaders need to interact with their audience.</p>

<h2>Active communities are driven by knowledge</h2>

<p>We can distinguish communities built upon friendship, professional
activity or common interests. The most active
are the ones based on a common interest, where knowledge and
feedback is a valuable resource. In these ones people spend a lot of time
looking for information. They also create a lot of content in order to
improve their reputation. Such platforms are even more
important for small communities because the resources they want to access are not always well
indexed by search engines.</p>

<p>As sharing information, working collaboratively and giving feedbacks to peers is key in
these communities even a very little one
can be very active.
There is still lots of
them to structure out there, lots of people waiting to
share and collaborate with their peers. Who are they? What can we do for
them?</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Albert Wenger is right:
<a href="http://continuations.com/post/20112755144/students-are-woefully-prepared-for-internet-age-job">we are woefully prepared for internet age job market</a>.
The three of us graduated in Computer Science in college, following a solid
engineering cursus. But during the
numerous courses we took we never heard of <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> nor <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>.
People attending creative and artistic
formation don't hear of <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> neither.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7044/7046351459_53d8ed3283.jpg" alt="Jeff Atwood" /></p>

<p>You could argue: "What's the problem with that? You aren't supposed to learn
how to use these platforms in school but core skills in your field!"</p>

<p>But that would be missing a point. The education we all receive has one final
goal: be prepared to get the best job as possible. In our current
era <strong>finding a job doesn't come down to respond to job offers by sending
cover letters and resume</strong> nor spam by email all our contacts in the industry
to get an interview.</p>

<p>We are lucky to live through the emergence and the
expansion of specialized platforms which can help us build our personal
and professional identity. With these platforms <strong>we can easily have a
professional visibility, expose our skills so they can be assessed by
everyone and acquire real experience with real work.</strong></p>

<p>The very first recommendation we should receive beginning a course in
a topic is registering on all the platforms related to this topic. The
professors should foster us to leverage these platform to develop our
skills, build our expertise and gain some fame. Such platforms work this way: they play with
our ego to encourage us to contribute more and more and make our
achievements visible for everyone in return. <strong>They are built to be our showcase</strong> and
we should take advantage of it. We do so many interesting projects in
school, sometimes state of the art implementations in CS, that get lost
on our machine. They should be public to catch recruiters' attention on
our profile and skills or help us <a href="http://cdixon.org/2012/02/26/the-internet-is-reshaping-our-economy-from-one-of-huge-corporations-with-lots-of-jobs-to-huge-platforms-with-lots-of-income-streams/">create our future income streams</a>.</p>

<p>So at which level can we improve the promotion of such platforms? At the school's level?
At the professors' level? They should all keep up with the internet economy like they
usually keep up with the <em>real</em> economy. Schools should increase professors' awareness, who
are mainly researchers in engineering schools for example, to this
concern but it's up to the professors to promote personaly the right
platforms. Professors do already a great job teaching us their
knowledge, <strong>they should go further and encourage us to capitalize on their
teaching</strong>.</p>
