    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Yo dawg, we heard you like reading Hacker News, so we put summaries in your links</h2>

<p>When you discovered that Superman could see through walls you told yourself that it was the awesomest thing ever. Naturally you wanted to have the same superpower.
Well let's say you can do that now on your browser and <strong>see through hyperlinks with our Chome Extension</strong>.</p>

<p>You love reading the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a> front page articles. But you don't always have the
time to click the links and read them all. That's
why we built this Chrome extension that enables you, <strong>simply by hovering over a
link, to read a summary of the article.</strong> How exciting is this?</p>

<p>Here is what this looks like:</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tldr/ohmamcbkcmfalompaelgoepcnbnpiioe" style="padding:25px;background:#008CD4;display:block;width:200px;margin:30px auto 0px auto;font-size:22px;font-family:CassanetBold, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica,border-radius:5px;color:white;border-radius:5px; text-align: center;" onClick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'Buttons', 'Click', 'Go to CRX install page']);">Install this awesome extension!</a></p>

<h2>Why does it only work on Hacker News? I want it everywhere!</h2>

<p>We know. We want that too. But as you know, <strong>our summaries are
human-written</strong> because <a href="http://needforair.com/blog/2012/04/06/why-computers-are-bad-at-summarizing-text/">computers are bad at summarizing</a>.
Today, the community writing summaries is still very small and can't handle a huge load. We summaries
them to be of the highest quality, so we chose to focus on Hacker News
so that we could bring a lot of value to our users while still having
the time to run our company.</p>

<p>You can help! If you like to find the key information in a technical
blogpost, if you want to help other people fight the information
overload or if you simply want tldr.io's coverage of the front page to
be even higher, you can <a href="http://tldr.io/whatisit#install-bm-section"><strong>use our contribution bookmarklet</a>
and start creating summaries</strong> too. We review all the summaries our users
create to ensure they stick to the original author's point of view, but
your contributing really helps the community.</p>

<h2>Why is it a Chrome extension? I want it on Firefox!</h2>

<p>We too! We're currently focusing on a Chrome extension to see how people
use it and how useful they find it. Once we think we have a clear idea
of what the extension should be, we will make a Firefox version. If you
have some ideas, <a href="http://tldr.io/forum/topics/50a4b8f45f5d3cd04a0001b7">please tell us here, we are interested</a>.</p>
