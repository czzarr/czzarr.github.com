    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most of what I consider genuinely useful and insightful
in my life today I learned from my parents and from my poker days. Poker made me fearless,
it made me think about long term, about positive expected value, it made me believe that you can get
really big even if you start with close to nothing.</p>

<p>Getting good at poker takes hard work, a lot of time dedicated to studying
theory, regular opponents, patterns, but also, and most importantly, a
lot of work on yourself to prevent tilt. Tilt is the name poker players
give to the phenomenon that happens when one gets a few bad beats in a
row and loses it. Somehow one feels forgotten, unjustly punished by the
poker gods and starts playing as though one is due for some good run of
cards. It usually ends up pretty badly. Self control is the key
to moving up in stakes and being succesful at online poker.</p>

<p>However, the one thing I noticed that differentiated the the very best, the smartest, the most
crazy good players from the merely very good players is that although
poker is a money game
these guys didn't give a fuck about money. They're ready to lose it all,
to lose $500k in one night even if that is 100% of their net worth
(acquired from poker exclusively usually)
because they 300% believe in their game, their edge and what
they're doing. They are unfathomably focused on outplaying their
opponent, not winning money. Somehow these players always end up
super rich. They end up going on killing sprees, annihilating
everyone that challenges them, because they focus on one thing:
the game. They don't care about PR, rakeback deals,
staking, how big their bankroll is at any given time, what they're gonna
be able to buy with that $500k they just won in a few hours, saving for
their retirement or whatever.</p>

<p>All they
care about is making the best play every single time, to the best
of their ability. That's how Tom 'durrrr' Dwan lost 5 millions (we're
talking about a self-made 20-something year-old guy here) in
a few days to Isildur1, some even younger Swedish sicko who appeared at of
nowhere and suddenly started beating every top player on Full Tilt Poker. Tom
Dwan continued playing because he thought he had an edge. He
didn't care about the money or he would've stopped way sooner.
Nobody likes to lose a few millions in a matter of hours. But he
bounced back. Not in this match, not against Isildur1. But in some
other games. It's all about passion. If you want to be the best at
something, you need to dive into it without asking questions, without
thinking about the risks, nor the rewards. Do it because that's what
make you pulse and feel alive.</p>

<p>Look at Mark Zuckerberg. He is the epitome of the startup rockstar. He is all about Facebook. He doesn't shift his focus from Facebook, doesn't care what people say about him or Facebook.
He is not afraid of losing one round, he makes all the moves that he
thinks are best for Facebook.
 He just plows away and in this regard reminds me
of the best poker players, only he plays at different stakes. And this why I'm gonna buy
Facebook stock as soon as my brokerage account is open.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>France's higher education trains world-class engineers, but is home to very few successful start-ups. Having studied engineering in France and then at Stanford University, I will try to explain this apparent paradox.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/billselak/2417001179/"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2168/2417001179_d5ce2d9362_m.jpg" alt="Test taking" /></a>

<h2>Party hard, study a bit, get straight As</h2>

<p>When I took my first classes at Stanford University, I was very
surprised by the difficulty level of engineering classes. My French friends and I found the material to be straightforward, the assignments and exams were easy and the grading more than forgiving. We would party a lot, study a bit, and still get close to 4.0 GPAs. Simply put, we thought we were on top of the world. Of course, we were wrong.</p>

<h2>The hard reality</h2>

<p>But then we took an entrepreneurship class ("hey, how hard can that
be ?"), and the professor asked us who had already created a company.
"What a joke, who creates a company at 22 ?" was the question that
crossed my mind. But three quarters of the class raised their hand,
and we realized that we were indeed not at the top of the world.</p>

<h2>Hone your test-taking skills</h2>

<p>If you are not French, you probably don't know anything about its arcane
higher education, and you can read <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1292">this PhD comic</a>
for a very good introduction. To sum it up, there is only one way to be part of the academic elite after high school,
and it is to enter the <em>"prepa"</em>, a two years long very intensive cursus at the end of which you take a competitive exam and get into the best school
(<em>"grande ecole"</em>) your rank enables you to. Once you get into one of these, you are assured you will easily land
one of the best/most well-paid jobs available.</p>

<p>There are good points to this system. It teaches us rigor, hard
work, how to handle pressure and a lot about theoretical science. But what we learn
best is how to do well at tests. And since it is so hard,
people from this system are still very proud of their
achievement 20 years later.</p>

<h2>"I can do it!"</h2>

<p>Basically in France, a lot of people believe that we can measure an
individual's skills by how well he fared in a test 20 years ago. We tend
to favorably view people with a perfect pedigree: the best school, and
then a job at an elite consulting or investment-banking firm. Trying to create a start-up but failing is
not well preceived at all.</p>

<p>Americans are very different. They believe that you should use the most
recent achievements to judge a person's skills, and that if you try, you
can do it. Where many a Frenchman would not even try for fear of failing,
Americans believe that success is inevitably down the road. And so
they try. And so they end up winning.</p>

<h2>The best of both worlds</h2>

<p>I don't think the French system is inherently bad. It produces very good engineers with a strong Math background that is useful to become a good coder. But it is time we stopped having this "everything is a test"
mentality, and understand that <strong>failing is not necessarily a bad thing, if you seriously
tried</strong>. Thinking like this would radically change the French start-up
ecosystem: not only would we have more entrepreneurs, but also less
risk-adverse investors, and more ambitious ideas.</p>
