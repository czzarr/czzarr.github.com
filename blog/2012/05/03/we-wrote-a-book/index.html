<div class="entry-content"><p>After two months of effort, our book is finally out. The collaborative
writing process is extremely interesting in itself and will be the topic
of subsequent blog posts. For now, we&#8217;re happy to introduce <a href="http://leanpub.com/startupflow">Startup
Flow</a>, a guide to getting set up as a
small team starting to work on a new venture. It addresses questions
about <strong>how to communicate</strong> - especially when <strong>working remotely</strong>, <strong>how to
share knowledge</strong> and <strong>how to collaborate on a code base</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://leanpub.com/startupflow"><img src="http://titlepages.leanpub.com/startupflow/bookpage?1335536785" alt="Startup Flow" /></a></p>

<p>Here are some answers to some
questions you might have:</p>

<h2>Who Is this Book For?</h2>

<p>If you are a <strong>small team beginning a technical entrepreneurial project</strong>
and you are struggling to organize your workflow, especially if some of you are
working remotely, this book is for you. It was written with both business people and developers
in mind as they&#8217;ll need to use common tools, however there are some more <em>technical</em> chapters
which are marked as such so that business people can skip them.</p>

<h2>Why You Need this Book</h2>

<p>You need it because <strong>it will save you a ton of time and
make your workdays much more pleasant</strong>.
Indeed, when you start working on a startup you quickly realize that you are
going to need some tools to organize your workflow. Especially if you
have cofounders, you will find yourself meeting too often, repeating yourself,
having a hard time following what everyone is doing, and this will be
very frustrating for all of you.</p>

<p>In order to fix these problems, <strong>you&#8217;ll need to choose your tools and design an efficient workflow</strong> through trial and error. <strong>That
takes a lot of time</strong>, given how many tools there are and how hard it is to
discriminate between them without actually trying them. <strong>We already went through that process,
and we compiled our findings</strong> in this book so that you can skip that part and start getting things done with
 great tools that will boost your productivity. Moreover, reading this book will help understand your core needs, even those you aren&#8217;t aware of yet.</p>

<h2>What Is in this Book?</h2>

<p>This book is a collection of the <strong>opinionated choices</strong> we made.
We focused on what we think are the most important components of a
startup workflow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Knowledge sharing and reuse</li>
<li>Codebase management</li>
</ul>


<p>With these 3 themes in mind, we offer a selection of tools, one tool
for one problem. The tools that we promote are the ones that we use
extensively everyday and that we chose after weeks of iteration.
Furthermore, they work very well together. We will describe these
<strong>synergies</strong> at the end of the book, so that you can take full advantage
of this work environment.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>Communication between teammates is a hard problem. It is necessary yet
so complicated to get right. A large portion of communication should be
asynchronous, enabling you to avoid useless interruptions that hurt your
and your teammates&#8217;
productivity. You also need to use different channels dedicated to different
use cases.</p>

<h3>Knowledge Sharing and Reuse</h3>

<p>All the knowledge that one finds interesting and usable should be
findable by the other teammates, without him having to send a link by
email or Skype every time. If knowledge is not shared or not reusable,
it&#8217;s worthless and you will lose a lot of time. This is especially true for
Eric Ries&#8217; <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/04/validated-learning-about-customers.html">validated learning</a>,
on which the whole team should be constantly focused.</p>

<h3>Codebase Management</h3>

<p>In a technical startup, coding is a vital activity. The developers need to
be able to code effectively on their own, but also to collaborate
seamlessly.
They need to be able to review one another&#8217;s code to ensure overall quality.
Teams that don&#8217;t do that will hit a wall.</p>

<p>If you do all these 3 things right, your team will be so efficient it will be
able to build the next Instagram in a week. No kidding!</p>

<h2>What this Book is Not</h2>

<p>This book is <strong>not</strong> a collection of tutorials. We will not guide you through the
process of installing and using everything in details. Instead we point you to quality
external resources.</p>

<p>It also doesn&#8217;t pretend to be the <em>be-all, end-all</em> guide on team
workflow for every case imaginable. However we feel it is the absolute
best for small teams working on a tech project, especially if the team
doesn&#8217;t have an office yet.</p>

<p>And, finally, it is not a startup guide. We won&#8217;t give you any advice as
to how to get your business off the ground, we&#8217;re not qualified for
that! If that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for, we recommend Eric Ries&#8217; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334839735&amp;sr=8-1"><em>The Lean Startup</em></a>, a must-read in our opinion.</p>

<h2>Why We Wrote this Book</h2>

<p>As we started working on ideas and on our startup, we faced the problem we
cited earlier. Our lack of organization was holding us back. So we spent
two weeks researching and trying different tools. After a
few iterations we finally reached a very efficient workflow and this investment
is now paying off big time. At first this was just an internal effort, but judging from the

<a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-for-a-startup-distributed-team-to-handle-document-management">you</a>
<a href="http://www.quora.com/Which-Project-Management-tools-are-most-useful-for-a-small-startup">can</a>
<a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-productivity-tools-for-entrepreneurs">find</a> on <a href="http://quora.com">Quora</a>,
we understood that many people could benefit from our research, and
so we decided to write this book.</p>
