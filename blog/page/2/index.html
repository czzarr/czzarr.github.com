<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/albertwenger">Albert Wenger</a> - February 29, 2012</em></p>

<ul>
<li>There is so much new content on the Web every day that one can barely
keep up with it</li>
<li>It is becoming ever harder to delve into the past, a problem
aggravated by Google&#8217;s recent tilt of their search algorithm towards
recency</li>
<li>We need to surface time explicitly. For example, imagine a version of
Techmeme where you can see the historical precedents of any post, or a
search engine that allows you to &#8220;scroll&#8221; into the past of any result</li>
</ul>

<p><em>by <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/courteney-palis">Courteney Palis, Huffington Post</a> - February 29, 2012</em></p>

<p><em>Palis describes the $35-a-piece Raspberry PI micro-computer and the
implications for the teaching of computer science</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Raspberry Pi device</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A complete computer for $35</li>
<li>Credit-card sized</li>
<li>&#8220;Last-decade&#8221; hardware (700 Mhz processor, 256 MB RAM) that&#8217;s still
enough to run Linux, code, browse the internet and even play games such
as Quake 3 !</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What this means</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Programming can be learned by almost anyone</li>
<li>People in poor areas, children in poor schools get access to technology</li>
<li>Like the Kinect, the Raspberry Pi will enable hackers to build ever
more impressive prototypes. The possibilities are endless</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/fredwilson">@fredwilson</a> - March 1, 2012</em></p>

<p><em>Fred Wilson explains why he thinks the Raspberry Pi is a game changer</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Hardware that&#8217;s currently expensive (phones and especially tablets)
is going to be cheaper and cheaper. We will see sub $100 tablets in 3 to
5 years</li>
<li>The Raspberry Pi&#8217;s goal is, according to the developper, to entice
children to learn to code. But all markets that can be end-to-end
digital, not just education, will be disrupted</li>

<h3><a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2012/02/29/lies-that-losers-tell/" title="Source">Lies that Losers Tell</a></h3>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bhorowitz">@bhorowitz</a> - Feb 29, 2012</em></p>

<p><em>Ben Horowitz describes the false explanations CEOs and employees find a
posteriori to justify their failure and why they do that. Stop burrying
your head in the sand.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Familiar lies</strong>

<ul>
<li>“<em>She left, but we were going to fire her, or give her a bad performance review</em>” : Instead of justifying the departure of your employees giving false excuses, ask yourself why you couldn&#8217;t keep them.</li>
<li>“<em>We would have won, but the other guys gave the deal away</em>” : Validate this claim with the actual customer instead of believing the Sales Rep who doesn&#8217;t want to take the blame.</li>
<li>&#8220;<em>Just because we missed the intermediate milestones doesn’t mean we won’t hit our product schedule</em>&#8221; : When the facts don’t align with the good news, a clever manager will find the narrative to make everybody feel better&#8230; until the next meeting.</li>
<li>“<em>We have a very high churn rate, but as soon as we turn on email marketing to our user base, people will come back</em>” : The reason that people leave our service and don’t come back is that we have not been sending them enough spam ?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Why are the CEOs/employees lying ?</strong>

<ul>
<li>Andy Grove explains that humans, particularly those who build things, only listen to leading indicators of good news and tend to justify bad news with false excuses.</li>
<li>Lying CEOs regularly take action on the positive indicator and look for alternative explanations on the negative indicator.</li>
<li>CEOs are not lying to investors, they are lying to themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=msuster">@msuster</a> - Jan 28, 2012</em></p>

<p><em>Mark Suster reacts to Fred Wilson&#8217;s blog post <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2010/09/mobile-first-web-second.html" title="AVC blog post">Mobile First, Web Second</a> reminding startups not to forget the Web</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>For 1.5 year people forgot Web Second and just thought Mobile First</strong>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s important not give up on the power of the tethered web, of large screen real estate, of a keyboard.</li>
<li>What&#8217;s even more important is to have a strategy that matches
customers wants and not developers whims.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mobile has clearly critical attributes</strong>

<ul>
<li>They are personal, location aware, occupy a lot of people&#8217;s leisure
time.</li>
<li>They are one touch away from buying and represent the &#8221;<em>bottom
end of the sales funnel</em>&#8221;</li>
<li>The limited real estate forces less choice and offers more focus on
the content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>But products have to be integrated</strong>

<ul>
<li>Many things cannot be done on a mobile</li>
<li>Mobile should serve a different experience, a different usecase of the service.</li>
<li>The web product can offer complementary services that make the
product even more attractive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Leverage the web to :</strong>

<ul>
<li>Create a differentiated product vs your mobile-only competitors.</li>
<li>Enable content creation and curation to make mobile consumption a better experience.</li>
<li>Organize and make the most of the content created by the mobile</li>
<li>Build features that make using native-phones apps pointless.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tablets come third</strong>

<ul>
<li>Extension to mobile strategy (larger real estate make content
  discovery different, increase the features possible&#8230;)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/codinghorror">@codinghorror</a> - Feb 3, 2012</em></p>

<p><em>Jeff Atwoods talks about the need to organize your community feedback
to take the most out of it</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Having a meta place to discuss the product is important</strong>

<ul>
<li>Meta participation is the source of all meaningful leadership and governance in a community, so it is cultivated and monitored closely.</li>
<li>Meta is for people who care so deeply about their community that they&#8217;re willing to go one step further, to come together and spend even more of their time deciding how to maintain and govern it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How to leverage this meta place ?</strong>

<ul>
<li>Animate the place : listen, respond</li>
<li>Sort between feedback and feature requests</li>
<li>Know how to extract core information and underlying needs from feature requests</li>
<li>Know to sort between useless and awesome feedback, 10% of the feedback is useful and can be gems</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t hesitate to be honest explaining the choices the company did
about the features the product offers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3><a href="http://mporat.tumblr.com/post/16753414806/what-asset-are-you-building" title="Source">What assets are you building ?</a></h3>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mporat">@mporat</a> - Jan 30, 2012</em></p>

<p>If you are building a consumer internet startup, you need to think about the assets that you are building and how these fit with your scaling and fundraising strategies.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Number of users</strong>

<ul>
<li>Most difficult to execute and scale because the lifetime value of a user is typically very low</li>
<li>Needs low customer acquisition cost, high retention, high conversion, tremendous growth, a lot of financing runway until the sheer number of users can generate huge revenues via advertising or traffic generation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>High lifetime value</strong>

<ul>
<li>No need for a lot of users, because you make a lot of money of them.</li>
<li>Rarely needs mass financing because they are cash cows</li>
<li>Can invest heavily in marketing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Massive data</strong>

<ul>
<li>Sometimes (twitter,instagram) the data inputted by the users is more important than the users</li>
<li>Free services to the user in order to leverage the data at scale</li>
<li>Usually requires a lot of financing until monetization is effective</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>A great platform</strong>

<ul>
<li>Monetization comes from 3rd parties (think facebook/zynga)</li>
<li>Main asset is user engagement with your platform</li>
<li>Need to build the platform as well as the first services on top of it</li>
<li>Needs a lot of financing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/12/13/five-new-management-metrics-you-need-to-know/2/" title="Source">Five New Management Metrics You Need To Know</a></h3>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jslavet">@jslavet</a> - Dec 13, 2011</em></p>

<p>Here is a list of 5 very important metrics that never appear in annual
reports. Most companies measure outputs but not inputs or throughput.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Flow State Percentage</strong>

<ul>
<li>Interruptions move us out of flow state which is the state that
enables the most productivity.</li>
<li>It takes seconds to get out of but can
take very long to get back in.</li>
<li>Measure how uninterrupted your
programmers are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Anxiety-Boredom Continuum</strong>

<ul>
<li>People want to be challenged, but not to the point that they break
down.</li>
<li>On the other hand, people will leave if they are bored.</li>
<li>Check in often with your employees to make sure you are striking the
right balance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Meeting Promoter Score</strong>

<ul>
<li>Meetings are very expensive and rarely productive</li>
<li>At the end of each meeting, ask each participant to rate it and
suggest improvements</li>
<li>Usually requires a lot of financing until monetization is effective</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Compound weekly learning rate</strong>

<ul>
<li>The ability to learn is like compounding interest on an investment</li>
<li>Ask your team: how did you get 1% better this week?</li>
<li>Did you learn something valuable from our customers?</li>
<li>Did you make a change to the product that drove better results?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Positive Feedback ratio</strong>

<ul>
<li>Catch people doing good things and tell them</li>
<li>This way when you provide feedback on areas to improve, they will
really listen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
