  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week Fab celebrated <a href="http://betashop.com/post/24759506656/happy-fabiversary-1-year-of-fab">their first anniversary</a>
(since their pivot, as <a href="http://betashop.com/post/19456853116/fab-was-an-overnight-success-on-day-474">Fab was not an overnight success on day
 one</a>).</p>

<p>Their growth has been amazing: 4.75 M members and +100 M in sales in just
one year. And it seems like it&#8217;s just the beginning as they&#8217;ve been successfully
conquering mobile users: 30% to 40% of Fabâ€™s daily visits are now via mobile. As mobile is the biggest
growth lever that an ecommerce company can have, these figures is a
good sign for the future Fab&#8217;s sales.</p>

<p>How did they perform so well? Mark Suster would say that they <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2012/05/23/its-morning-in-venture-capital/">flawlessly executed their business
model</a> but I&#8217;d
go deeper in the reasons and say that their success comes from their <a href="http://betashop.com/post/13607881842/10-ways-fab-is-building-a-different-type-of-company">core beliefs
</a>
and the energy they put to broadcast them.</p>

<p><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/163/brocode.png/"><img src="http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/8470/brocode.png" alt="BroCode" /></a></p>

<p>They <em>believe</em> in a vision, in core principles they love to repeat as
much as possible. This is even their first statements in their <a href="http://betashop.com/post/24759506656/happy-fabiversary-1-year-of-fab">Happy
Fabiversary blog post</a>. You can search for
each of these belief in their blog to see how often they come back. These values stand at
the epicenter of their attitude and drive.</p>

<p>Fab communicates their beliefs with such a passion that we can
feel them behind every single line of text in their
website, behind every single quote from Jason Goldberg. Their gimmick
<em>To Make You Smile</em> underlies all their decisions and choices: <em>Color is
very important, color makes people smile.</em> At Fab they have their core
principles and they stick to it: <em>We care more about making people smile
than making money from them</em>.</p>

<p>Even if one could argue that they do it just for marketing purposes I
truly think they do it because they uphold totally their core beliefs. They communicate their
vision perfectly and make people adhere to it because they act like
passionate leaders.</p>

<p>Choosing core values and placing every single decision the company makes
in the perspective of these values is what makes me smile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of what I consider genuinely useful and insightful
in my life today I learned from my parents and from my poker days. Poker made me fearless,
it made me think about long term, about positive expected value, it made me believe that you can get
really big even if you start with close to nothing.</p>

<p>Getting good at poker takes hard work, a lot of time dedicated to studying
theory, regular opponents, patterns, but also, and most importantly, a
lot of work on yourself to prevent tilt. Tilt is the name poker players
give to the phenomenon that happens when one gets a few bad beats in a
row and loses it. Somehow one feels forgotten, unjustly punished by the
poker gods and starts playing as though one is due for some good run of
cards. It usually ends up pretty badly. Self control is the key
to moving up in stakes and being succesful at online poker.</p>

<p>However, the one thing I noticed that differentiated the the very best, the smartest, the most
crazy good players from the merely very good players is that although
poker is a money game
these guys didn&#8217;t give a fuck about money. They&#8217;re ready to lose it all,
to lose $500k in one night even if that is 100% of their net worth
(acquired from poker exclusively usually)
because they 300% believe in their game, their edge and what
they&#8217;re doing. They are unfathomably focused on outplaying their
opponent, not winning money. Somehow these players always end up
super rich. They end up going on killing sprees, annihilating
everyone that challenges them, because they focus on one thing:
the game. They don&#8217;t care about PR, rakeback deals,
staking, how big their bankroll is at any given time, what they&#8217;re gonna
be able to buy with that $500k they just won in a few hours, saving for
their retirement or whatever.</p>

<p><a href="http://memegenerator.net"><img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/11882883.jpg" alt="I Don't give a shit" /></a></p>

<p>All they
care about is making the best play every single time, to the best
of their ability. That&#8217;s how Tom &#8216;durrrr&#8217; Dwan lost 5 millions (we&#8217;re
talking about a self-made 20-something year-old guy here) in
a few days to Isildur1, some even younger Swedish sicko who appeared at of
nowhere and suddenly started beating every top player on Full Tilt Poker. Tom
Dwan continued playing because he thought he had an edge. He
didn&#8217;t care about the money or he would&#8217;ve stopped way sooner.
Nobody likes to lose a few millions in a matter of hours. But he
bounced back. Not in this match, not against Isildur1. But in some
other games. It&#8217;s all about passion. If you want to be the best at
something, you need to dive into it without asking questions, without
thinking about the risks, nor the rewards. Do it because that&#8217;s what
make you pulse and feel alive.</p>

<p>Look at Mark Zuckerberg. He is the epitome of the startup rockstar. He is all about Facebook. He doesn&#8217;t shift his focus from Facebook, doesn&#8217;t care what people say about him or Facebook.
He is not afraid of losing one round, he makes all the moves that he
thinks are best for Facebook.
 He just plows away and in this regard reminds me
of the best poker players, only he plays at different stakes. And this why I&#8217;m gonna buy
Facebook stock as soon as my brokerage account is open.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since the Facebook&#8217;s IPO fiasco, many commenters (mainly bloggers and Wall Street analysts)
seem keen to say that Facebook is really not worth that much. I don&#8217;t agree, because I think
that trying to determine Facebook&#8217;s value is premature.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinkrejci/7218818780/" target="_blank"><img alt="Facebook headquarters" src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5320/7218818780_9507a57365_n.jpg" height="320px" width="320px"></a>
<em>CC Licence - Author: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinkrejci/">Kevin Krejci</a></em></p>

<h2>Facebook&#8217;s IPO Surely Didn&#8217;t Go Well</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s a well-known fact, but it always makes me cringe: I still don&#8217;t
understand why <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/daniel-dicker/facebook-retail-investors_b_1549602.html">well-connected people would have the right to buy shares
at a better price than &#8220;normal&#8221; investors</a>.
But it&#8217;s a fact: if you are one of the underwriters&#8217; best clients, you
will be able to purchase the stock at its opening price (in Facebook&#8217;s
case $38 per share). You will even able to purchase the stock before the IPO, at a lower price than $38.
If you&#8217;re not, you will have to wait. In this IPO,
retail (&#8220;normal&#8221;) investors had to <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/47043815//">wait until the stock traded at $42 a
share</a> before being able to buy. On
top of this common IPO problem, key information was known to insiders but not
shared with all investors, which is why <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57439918-93/facebook-zuckerberg-sued-over-ipo/">Facebook has been sued</a>.
In that regard, Facebook&#8217;s IPO surely didn&#8217;t go well.</p>

<h2>Nobody Knows Facebook&#8217;s True Worth</h2>

<p>But even though it didn&#8217;t go well, I am puzzled to read so many negative
comments about Facebook itself. All kinds of people, from bloggers to
Wall Street analyst seem to forget that Facebook still is a
multi-billion dollars business. What I think many fail to see is that,
in fact, nobody can seriously pretend to know Facebook&#8217;s true worth. It
could be <a href="http://cdixon.org/2012/05/15/facebooks-business-model/">worth a lot more, or a lot less</a>.
This is different from a traditional company, for which everybody knows
the business model (think GM, Total or even Apple). In Facebook&#8217;s case,
we don&#8217;t know how they&#8217;re going to monetize their 900M users. Is it
going to be through advertising? A premium version? Will they be able to
make money on mobile platforms? We (at least I) don&#8217;t know. A Facebook share is a lottery
ticket, whose value today has nothing to do with its value tomorrow. I for one am
no Facebook expert, so instead of trying to guess the future, I will
just sit back, relax, and see how the Facebook team continues to innovate.</p>
