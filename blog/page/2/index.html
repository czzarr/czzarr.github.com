  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, <a href="http://robgo.org/about/">Rob Go</a> from <a href="http://nextviewventures.com/">NextViewVentures</a>
explained why in his opinion people should <a href="http://robgo.org/2012/05/14/think-twice-before-starting-a-company/">think twice before starting a
company</a>: too much
hype, harder to stand out, we are at the end of one innovation cycle and at the beginning of a new one
which is less favorable to unexperienced and non-technical founders.</p>

<p>So to the question <a href="http://robgo.org/2012/06/10/what-to-do-instead-of-starting-a-company/"><em>What to do instead of starting a company?</em></a>
he answers: <em>Join the winningest company you can find in a sector you care about with people you like</em>.
Should you agree or not, this recommendation has its pros and cons but one can&#8217;t come to
a decision easily. The most important lesson to learn comes at the end:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/2324/imagerxss.jpg" width="220"></p>

<blockquote><p>I think there is just the inherent satisfaction of being a part of a
company that is making a big dent in the world.  We’d all like to be the
person who started that company, but there is a huge amount of pride to
be had in being a contributor, even if you aren’t a leader.  Also,
scale and success give companies the right to do something meaningful.
I often hear founders of failed companies lament “I realized that I
just wasn’t that excited about X, Y, or Z market.”  Well, the truth
is, most people probably aren’t that excited about about helping
merchants process credit cards (until Square) or the apartment
rental industry (until Air BnB) or local advertising (until FourSquare),
or the private car industry (until Uber) etc etc. Being part of a successful
company that is shaping the future of an industry is usually inherently
interesting and motivating, and it’s a great way to spend a few years
of your life until the time is right for you to start a company that will do the same.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s a very interesting analysis as he doesn&#8217;t try to give a clear cut
and general solution applicable to everybody. Instead he takes into
account the personality of people who could be disposed to start a
company, noting that founding a startup is not necesseraly the best fit for them.
The true concern one should have is to make a dent in the world. <a href="http://markbivens.com/m/about">Mark Bivens</a>
came to the same conclusion: <a href="http://markbivens.com/m/archives/feeling-a-part-of-something-bigger">People need to feel a part of something bigger</a>
and joining a startup could be the best answer to this feeling. It will never be
be too late to found its company after such an experience, on the
contrary it can only make things easier.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week Fab celebrated <a href="http://betashop.com/post/24759506656/happy-fabiversary-1-year-of-fab">their first anniversary</a>
(since their pivot, as <a href="http://betashop.com/post/19456853116/fab-was-an-overnight-success-on-day-474">Fab was not an overnight success on day
 one</a>).</p>

<p>Their growth has been amazing: 4.75 M members and +100 M in sales in just
one year. And it seems like it&#8217;s just the beginning as they&#8217;ve been successfully
conquering mobile users: 30% to 40% of Fab’s daily visits are now via mobile. As mobile is the biggest
growth lever that an ecommerce company can have, these figures is a
good sign for the future Fab&#8217;s sales.</p>

<p>How did they perform so well? Mark Suster would say that they <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2012/05/23/its-morning-in-venture-capital/">flawlessly executed their business
model</a> but I&#8217;d
go deeper in the reasons and say that their success comes from their <a href="http://betashop.com/post/13607881842/10-ways-fab-is-building-a-different-type-of-company">core beliefs
</a>
and the energy they put to broadcast them.</p>

<p><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/163/brocode.png/"><img src="http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/8470/brocode.png" alt="BroCode" /></a></p>

<p>They <em>believe</em> in a vision, in core principles they love to repeat as
much as possible. This is even their first statements in their <a href="http://betashop.com/post/24759506656/happy-fabiversary-1-year-of-fab">Happy
Fabiversary blog post</a>. You can search for
each of these belief in their blog to see how often they come back. These values stand at
the epicenter of their attitude and drive.</p>

<p>Fab communicates their beliefs with such a passion that we can
feel them behind every single line of text in their
website, behind every single quote from Jason Goldberg. Their gimmick
<em>To Make You Smile</em> underlies all their decisions and choices: <em>Color is
very important, color makes people smile.</em> At Fab they have their core
principles and they stick to it: <em>We care more about making people smile
than making money from them</em>.</p>

<p>Even if one could argue that they do it just for marketing purposes I
truly think they do it because they uphold totally their core beliefs. They communicate their
vision perfectly and make people adhere to it because they act like
passionate leaders.</p>

<p>Choosing core values and placing every single decision the company makes
in the perspective of these values is what makes me smile.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Most of what I consider genuinely useful and insightful
in my life today I learned from my parents and from my poker days. Poker made me fearless,
it made me think about long term, about positive expected value, it made me believe that you can get
really big even if you start with close to nothing.</p>

<p>Getting good at poker takes hard work, a lot of time dedicated to studying
theory, regular opponents, patterns, but also, and most importantly, a
lot of work on yourself to prevent tilt. Tilt is the name poker players
give to the phenomenon that happens when one gets a few bad beats in a
row and loses it. Somehow one feels forgotten, unjustly punished by the
poker gods and starts playing as though one is due for some good run of
cards. It usually ends up pretty badly. Self control is the key
to moving up in stakes and being succesful at online poker.</p>

<p>However, the one thing I noticed that differentiated the the very best, the smartest, the most
crazy good players from the merely very good players is that although
poker is a money game
these guys didn&#8217;t give a fuck about money. They&#8217;re ready to lose it all,
to lose $500k in one night even if that is 100% of their net worth
(acquired from poker exclusively usually)
because they 300% believe in their game, their edge and what
they&#8217;re doing. They are unfathomably focused on outplaying their
opponent, not winning money. Somehow these players always end up
super rich. They end up going on killing sprees, annihilating
everyone that challenges them, because they focus on one thing:
the game. They don&#8217;t care about PR, rakeback deals,
staking, how big their bankroll is at any given time, what they&#8217;re gonna
be able to buy with that $500k they just won in a few hours, saving for
their retirement or whatever.</p>

<p><a href="http://memegenerator.net"><img src="http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/11882883.jpg" alt="I Don't give a shit" /></a></p>

<p>All they
care about is making the best play every single time, to the best
of their ability. That&#8217;s how Tom &#8216;durrrr&#8217; Dwan lost 5 millions (we&#8217;re
talking about a self-made 20-something year-old guy here) in
a few days to Isildur1, some even younger Swedish sicko who appeared at of
nowhere and suddenly started beating every top player on Full Tilt Poker. Tom
Dwan continued playing because he thought he had an edge. He
didn&#8217;t care about the money or he would&#8217;ve stopped way sooner.
Nobody likes to lose a few millions in a matter of hours. But he
bounced back. Not in this match, not against Isildur1. But in some
other games. It&#8217;s all about passion. If you want to be the best at
something, you need to dive into it without asking questions, without
thinking about the risks, nor the rewards. Do it because that&#8217;s what
make you pulse and feel alive.</p>

<p>Look at Mark Zuckerberg. He is the epitome of the startup rockstar. He is all about Facebook. He doesn&#8217;t shift his focus from Facebook, doesn&#8217;t care what people say about him or Facebook.
He is not afraid of losing one round, he makes all the moves that he
thinks are best for Facebook.
 He just plows away and in this regard reminds me
of the best poker players, only he plays at different stakes. And this why I&#8217;m gonna buy
Facebook stock as soon as my brokerage account is open.</p>
