  <div class="entry-content"><p>At Google I/O there were <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/google-io-product-announcements-2012-6?op=1">many interesting announcements</a>: <a href="http://gigaom.com/mobile/nexus-7-first-look-its-here-to-snuff-kindles-fire/">Nexus 7</a>, Google
Glass, etc. (Perhaps too many as one can say that <a href="http://gigaom.com/2012/06/27/google-vs-everyone/">Google is fighting too
many ennemies on too many fronts</a>).
One news that drew my attention is the arrival of Google Chrome on iOs. <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/28/hands-on-with-googles-chrome-for-ios-just-like-chrome-for-android-only-slower/">Don&#8217;t expect browsing
experience improvement</a>
you had on your desktop as this app is merely a graphical
layer on top of Apple&#8217;s WebView from its SDK. Basically the engine is the same as Safari &#8230;
just slower.</p>

<p>But that&#8217;s not my point. I want to talk about the sync functionnality
that Google Chrome on iOS offers: by activating the sync on your
different devices (desktop, iPad, iPhone&#8230;) you can open a tab you were
viewing in one device on another one. The <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/26/a-modest-proposal-the-continuous-client/">Continous Client</a> becomes real.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://img802.imageshack.us/img802/3818/passthebaton.jpg" width="340"></p>

<blockquote><p>So what is a Continuous Client you ask? Well the premise is simple: when you leave one device, you pick up your session in exactly the same place on the next device you use. Meaning your IM, Twitter, web browsing, applications, even your windows appear just as they did on the previous device. The situation I describe above would be obviated by this setup, allowing me to move from my laptop to iPad in a seamless manner which would in no way disrupt the activity I was currently engaged in. [&#8230;] Put simply, you are placeshifting your computing experience from one device to the next with no break in your work, timelines, or conversations.</p></blockquote>

<p>After using the cloud to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">store persistent data easily</a> and
<a href="https://www.icloud.com/">seamlessly</a>,
one can now use it as a relay to get a continuous browsing experience
across different devices.</p>

<p>We can moreover imagine various implementations of the continuous client to enhance our global user experience.
For example, <a href="http://www.invoxia.com/en/">Invoxia</a> with its business dock adopts the same
vision for phone by bridging mobile and office calls.</p>

<p>My experience of these two continous clients is so magic but nonetheless so
natural that I&#8217;m looking forward to future ones that will be invented to make our everyday life even more
pleasant and interruptions-free.</p>

<p>And you, do you know another usecase where a continuous client architecture is
already available?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On <a href="http://freddestin.com/2012/06/get-your-kid-coding-with-codeclub-with-free-viral-video.html">Fred Destin&#8217;s initiative</a>, the big stars
at <a href="http://foundersforum.eu/">Founders Forum</a>, including Niklas ZennStr√∂m
(Skype), Chad Hurley (Youtube) and many others, shooted last week a funny
and viral video to promote <a href="http://www.codeclub.org.uk/">CodeClub</a>.
CodeClub is a brilliant action which aims at <em>inspiring kids to learn
code and creating a nationwide after school coding club for children aged 10-11</em>.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/FxhGIajRsq4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>Kids are the future, everybody knows it. Computer are, too. When we see what
our generation&#8217;s geniuses made and how they revolutionized our world
when computer science and coding were at their premises, one
can only urge the next generation to dive into code as
soon as possible.</p>

<p>Supporting this initiative is supporting a long term vision for our
economy and our education system. There is no day without reading that
there is a big lack of great programmers, that <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/news/2012/060412-data-scientist-259697.html">data-scientist is the
hottest job at this time</a>
or that <a href="http://www.elezea.com/2012/04/programming-and-thinking/">learning to code is a great move</a>.
So we should foster our kids to embrace this activity as soon as
possible as informatics, hardware will be everywhere. By extending the base
of people having the skills to program we foster the future innovation.</p>

<p>The earlier we start learning something the better we are good at it and the
less we fear it. We belong to a generation where there is
still a big proportion of people who are not at ease with computers or
smartphones. Even an entreprising friend of mine judges that it&#8217;s too
late for him to start learning how to code whereas he&#8217;s only 25! But have you
experienced <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXV-yaFmQNk">kids change of behaviour</a> towards our world?
I don&#8217;t think there will be many kids in 10 years who won&#8217;t know how to
use a smartphone. And I do want to think that these kids in 10 years won&#8217;t
be as reluctant to learn code as people can be today. Perhaps the
qualifiers <em>geeky</em> or <em>nerd</em> won&#8217;t exist anymore, or have a very distant meaning,
commensurate to what these people have created by now.
Who knows ?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last week, <a href="http://robgo.org/about/">Rob Go</a> from <a href="http://nextviewventures.com/">NextViewVentures</a>
explained why in his opinion people should <a href="http://robgo.org/2012/05/14/think-twice-before-starting-a-company/">think twice before starting a
company</a>: too much
hype, harder to stand out, we are at the end of one innovation cycle and at the beginning of a new one
which is less favorable to unexperienced and non-technical founders.</p>

<p>So to the question <a href="http://robgo.org/2012/06/10/what-to-do-instead-of-starting-a-company/"><em>What to do instead of starting a company?</em></a>
he answers: <em>Join the winningest company you can find in a sector you care about with people you like</em>.
Should you agree or not, this recommendation has its pros and cons but one can&#8217;t come to
a decision easily. The most important lesson to learn comes at the end:</p>

<p><img class="right" src="http://img84.imageshack.us/img84/2324/imagerxss.jpg" width="220"></p>

<blockquote><p>I think there is just the inherent satisfaction of being a part of a
company that is making a big dent in the world.  We‚Äôd all like to be the
person who started that company, but there is a huge amount of pride to
be had in being a contributor, even if you aren‚Äôt a leader.  Also,
scale and success give companies the right to do something meaningful.
I often hear founders of failed companies lament ‚ÄúI realized that I
just wasn‚Äôt that excited about X, Y, or Z market.‚Äù  Well, the truth
is, most people probably aren‚Äôt that excited about about helping
merchants process credit cards (until Square) or the apartment
rental industry (until Air BnB) or local advertising (until FourSquare),
or the private car industry (until Uber) etc etc. Being part of a successful
company that is shaping the future of an industry is usually inherently
interesting and motivating, and it‚Äôs a great way to spend a few years
of your life until the time is right for you to start a company that will do the same.</p></blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s a very interesting analysis as he doesn&#8217;t try to give a clear cut
and general solution applicable to everybody. Instead he takes into
account the personality of people who could be disposed to start a
company, noting that founding a startup is not necesseraly the best fit for them.
The true concern one should have is to make a dent in the world. <a href="http://markbivens.com/m/about">Mark Bivens</a>
came to the same conclusion: <a href="http://markbivens.com/m/archives/feeling-a-part-of-something-bigger">People need to feel a part of something bigger</a>
and joining a startup could be the best answer to this feeling. It will never be
be too late to found its company after such an experience, on the
contrary it can only make things easier.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week Fab celebrated <a href="http://betashop.com/post/24759506656/happy-fabiversary-1-year-of-fab">their first anniversary</a>
(since their pivot, as <a href="http://betashop.com/post/19456853116/fab-was-an-overnight-success-on-day-474">Fab was not an overnight success on day
 one</a>).</p>

<p>Their growth has been amazing: 4.75 M members and +100 M in sales in just
one year. And it seems like it&#8217;s just the beginning as they&#8217;ve been successfully
conquering mobile users: 30% to 40% of Fab‚Äôs daily visits are now via mobile. As mobile is the biggest
growth lever that an ecommerce company can have, these figures is a
good sign for the future Fab&#8217;s sales.</p>

<p>How did they perform so well? Mark Suster would say that they <a href="http://www.bothsidesofthetable.com/2012/05/23/its-morning-in-venture-capital/">flawlessly executed their business
model</a> but I&#8217;d
go deeper in the reasons and say that their success comes from their <a href="http://betashop.com/post/13607881842/10-ways-fab-is-building-a-different-type-of-company">core beliefs
</a>
and the energy they put to broadcast them.</p>

<p><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/163/brocode.png/"><img src="http://img163.imageshack.us/img163/8470/brocode.png" alt="BroCode" /></a></p>

<p>They <em>believe</em> in a vision, in core principles they love to repeat as
much as possible. This is even their first statements in their <a href="http://betashop.com/post/24759506656/happy-fabiversary-1-year-of-fab">Happy
Fabiversary blog post</a>. You can search for
each of these belief in their blog to see how often they come back. These values stand at
the epicenter of their attitude and drive.</p>

<p>Fab communicates their beliefs with such a passion that we can
feel them behind every single line of text in their
website, behind every single quote from Jason Goldberg. Their gimmick
<em>To Make You Smile</em> underlies all their decisions and choices: <em>Color is
very important, color makes people smile.</em> At Fab they have their core
principles and they stick to it: <em>We care more about making people smile
than making money from them</em>.</p>

<p>Even if one could argue that they do it just for marketing purposes I
truly think they do it because they uphold totally their core beliefs. They communicate their
vision perfectly and make people adhere to it because they act like
passionate leaders.</p>

<p>Choosing core values and placing every single decision the company makes
in the perspective of these values is what makes me smile.</p>
