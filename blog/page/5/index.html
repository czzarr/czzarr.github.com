  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other day I had a conversation on Twitter with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rjs">Ryan
Singer</a> of <a href="http://37signals.com">37 Signals</a>
fame. Ryan is a world-class expert in product design and had just posted an <a href="http://feltpresence.com/articles/16-managing-product-development-by-integrating-around-concerns">article</a>
on his excellent <a href="http://feltpresence.com/">blog</a>. The thing is I am a
nobody in product design or in the tech scene in general. I&#8217;m not saying
I&#8217;m dumb or anything, just that nobody knows me. And yet I was
still able to have a great and stimulating conversation with an expert
who&#8217;s email inbox is presumably very full, lives thousands of kilometers
away from me and doesn&#8217;t know anything about me. This was not the first
time I&#8217;ve been amazed by the power of Twitter, so I decided to blog about
it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/brajeshwar/3428525318/in/photostream"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3393/3428525318_0729579705_n.jpg" alt="Twitter Mosaic" /></a>

<h2>140 characters Enable Improbable Conversations</h2>

<p>That length constraint compels people to get straight to the point.
There is no fluff. No awkward openings, no pompous endings, no walls of
text. People expect direct questions and answers and wouldn&#8217;t have it any other
way.</p>

<p>This magically enables you to talk to some people you would never have sent an
email to. And busy people that don&#8217;t know you at all, that might be
thought leaders or experts, will answer you if
you ask an interesting question. Because the constraint also works for
the response: they don&#8217;t have to send you a long well thought-out answer,
they don&#8217;t need to get context to answer, they can just type 140
characters.</p>

<p>I have asked questions to succesful entrepreneurs, or VCs, and almost
always gotten a quick answer. This is incredibly cool and powerful. And
these people don&#8217;t know me at all.</p>

<h2>No Social Pressure or Awkwardness</h2>

<p>The Twitter feed moves so swiftly that conversations are extremely
ephemeral. I think this is key to enabling these kinds of improbable
conversations. The fact that it moves so quickly reduces the social
pressure: few people will see it, it will not mark your Twitter profile
for a long time, and nobody will assume that the two people conversing
are great friends or anything. Twitter enables conversations in a
vacuum, without having to build up a relationship. There is no pressure
for the expert to become friend with the person he is talking to.</p>

<p>When you try to email or talk on the phone to an expert, you always want to be super apologetic,
respectful and you don&#8217;t really focus on the content of the
conversation you&#8217;re trying to have but instead you focus on the
asymmetry of the relationship and that makes you uncomfortable. Twitter makes all these concerns vanish.</p>

<p>I love Twitter for these opportunities.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The game of go is very interesting from an AI programmer&#8217;s point of
view, because of how difficult it is to make a computer compete against
a strong human and how researchers approached the problem. Paradoxically, the use of randomly played games has helped computers get much stronger.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/92544159@N00/322662164/"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/134/322662164_0260e91add_n.jpg" alt="Go" /></a>
<em>by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/obli/" title="Author">oblivionz</a></em></p>

<h2>Game of Go: a (very) brief overview</h2>

<p>Go is wildly popular in Asia but little known in the Western world. Similar to Chess, it is a strategy game where two players take
turn placing stones on a board. The key differences between these
two are:</p>

<ul>
<li>In Go, the board starts empty, and you add stones at each turn whereas in
chess you start with an army and try to destroy the other one</li>
<li>The <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?RulesOfGoIntroductory">rules</a> are much simpler in Go than in Chess: in particular there is only one type of stone while Chess uses six different pieces</li>
</ul>


<p>I really encourage you to check it out, you can <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?RulesOfGoIntroductory">learn to play here</a> and <a href="http://www.gokgs.com/">play here</a>.</p>

<h2>Compexity, comparison to chess</h2>

<p>Even though the rules are simple, it has proven to be very hard to
build a good Go-playing program. In fact, while top Chess-playing
softwares can compete with the best humans (remember how Deep Blue beat
Gary Kasparov in 1997), even strong amateurs can beat the top Go-playing
programs. And strong amateurs are much weaker than top pros. There are three main reasons for this:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Game-tree complexity</strong>: there are about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shannon_number">10<sup>123</sup> possible games
in Chess</a>. As for Go,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_and_mathematics">estimates vary</a> but
the <a href="http://www.usgo.org/resources/topten.html">American Go Association reckons there are 10<sup>700</sup> possible
games</a>. This is because there
are more turns in a Go game than in a Chess game (200 vs 50 on average),
and more possibilities at each turn in Go (up to 350 vs 50).</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_function">Lack of a good heuristic</a></strong>: Chess programs are able to evaluate quite accurately and quickly whether a given position is better than another one. On the contrary, no good heuristic has been found for Go yet.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern-recognition</strong>: strong Go players rely heavily on recognizing
the shapes the stones take. There are too many of them for a computer
to try and recognize in a game timeframe, and <a href="http://curiosity.discovery.com/question/humans-better-than-computers">humans are much better than them at this</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Key ideas behind current Go-playing programs</h2>

<p>This complexity is what makes the study of Go algorithms so interesting.
A few years ago we saw a spectacular improvement, led by a
program called <a href="http://www.lri.fr/~teytaud/mogo.html">MoGo</a>. The key
ideas behind MoGo are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Position evaluation using random games</strong>: paradoxically, it was
found that the best way to evaluate a position is to play, from this
position, a lot of games were each player puts stones at random
on the board. A position&#8217;s score is simply the percentage of won
random games.</li>
<li><strong>Use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">multi-armed bandit</a> algorithms</strong> to decrease the branching factor (the number of moves the program has to consider at each turn). The goal here is to optimize the trade-off between exploration (trying new moves) and exploitation (further testing the most promising moves to select the best one). The computer begins with a prior probability distribution for every possible move. It picks one according to this distribution, plays a random game from the corresponding position and uses the result to update the probability for this move. It then selects another possible move according to the updated distribution and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Use of a little expert knowledge</strong>: the prior distribution used in the
multi-armed bandit is calculated so as to avoid trivially stupid moves.
For the opening of the game, classic starting positions are also
favored. And the random games are not completely random since they avoid
certain moves according to simple patterns. Nonetheless, expert
knowledge is used scarcely as it really hurts the exploration part of
the algorithm.</li>
<li><strong>Parallelization</strong>: MoGo and the likes can become very good on
computer clusters, since the random game part can be run on mutliple
CPUs. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl's_law">speedup factor</a> is
about 8x.</li>
<li><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong>: MoGo learns during the game and the
randoms play-outs that some kind of responses to his opponent&#8217;s moves are likely to have a bad
result, and assigns them a lower probability.</li>
</ul>


<p>You can learn more on MoGo <a href="http://www.pleinsud.u-psud.fr/specialR2008/en/12_GOthique.pdf">in this article</a>.</p>

<h2>Current strength of computers</h2>

<p>Today, Go-playing programs are able to compete with professional players on small (9x9) boards, and with strong amateurs (5d KGS) on normal boards (19x19). This is quite an achievement, but there is still a long way to go before they can face professional players on normal boards!</p>

<p><em>I am a Go player myself, even though not very good! During an
internship in a Computer Science laboratory, I worked on <a href="http://www.lri.fr/~teytaud/mogo.html">MoGo</a> for 2 months in 2008.</em><br/>
<em>Special thanks to <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/arpad-rimmel/b/9a7/847">Arpad Rimmel</a> for having reviewed this article. He spent 3 years working on Mogo when he was a PhD student.</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Various creative initiatives face the same challenges as startups.
In its
<a href="http://leanpub.com/manifesto">manifesto</a>, <a href="http://leanpub.com/">Leanpub</a> points out the similarities
between writing a book and launching a startup: <em>both are risky, creative
processes, often undertaken in stealth mode and with hit-driven economics.</em></p>

<p>The same parallel can be drawn with the music industry or more generally
with independant creative activities. Crowdfunding platforms
<a href="http://www.mymajorcompany.com/">MyMajorCompany</a> or <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">KickStarter</a>
illustrate the similarities between all these processes.
Independant singers who are not supported by famous productors bear the risk,
have to build their <em>product</em> and develop their marketing
strategy on their own.</p>

<p>Once the beta version of the product is ready to showcase, a single in
the case of singers, the difficulty is to market it. How can one achieve
some traction? One option that seems profitable is to place the
product in a favourable context by attaching it to an event which
benefits from a good media coverage. Mainstream and new medias alike have such a big impact
on the crowd that they can drain lots of attention. Leveraging these
media can be key.</p>

<p>Recently in France a singer succeeded in creating a buzz
on the internet, hitting more than 600 000 views on Youtube, with its
single on a candidate for the presidential elections. In the same vein
as <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKsoXHYICqU"><em>I got a crush on Obama</em></a> she drew the media attention in a very
effective way by leveraging the current context.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/40084651"><img src="http://www.lalsace.fr/fr/images/A7098988-85DA-4603-8E31-654249FE82BB/ALS_03/capture-d-ecran-du-clip-musical-de-victoire-passage-prends-le-pouvoir-sur-moi-jean-luc-melenchon.jpg" width="400" alt="Video" /></a></p>

<p>Making a buzz gives the impression of success. But how can we be assured it is going to last? Does a spike in the audience really help to succeed with
one&#8217;s product? When one realize that <a href="http://simply.io/blog/2012/03/welcome-to-the-real-world-just-because-youre-on-techcrunch-doesnt-mean-youve-won/">90% of the companies appearing on TC
are abandoned within 6 months</a>
one can question the relevance of the press coverage and the buzz one
can create to build a durable success. Instead, one should be focused
on building one&#8217;s audience. Successfull startups and creators don&#8217;t
rely on a single shot try, they build their success gradually at the same
time as their audience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I <a href="http://needforair.com/blog/2012/04/04/what-we-didnt-learn-in-college/">already wrote</a> about how
you can leverage some <a href="https://github.com/">social platforms</a> to build
your visibility on the internet, but they offer much more.
They provide appropriate tools that help people to be more productive
and better organized. They are much more functional than pure social networks
and even more valuable as the communities are active.</p>

<p><img src="http://cardview.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/nation-builder.jpg" height="220" alt="Keep the gist" /></p>

<h2>Platforms structure communities</h2>

<p>We can call such a platform a <em>community organizing platform</em> because
it allows a community to have a place to gather, discuss and share. It
provides the global structure the community needs to get organized.
Ten years ago the forums laid the foundation but today these platforms
achieve what&#8217;s been initiated.</p>

<p>Using these platforms everyone creates and manages a business card that
is accessible by everyone else.
People can easily be identified, followed, consulted and appraised. You
don&#8217;t have to go to as many conferences or events to meet new people
because it can be done very efficiently online.</p>

<h2>Community organizing platforms offer more than pure social networks</h2>

<p>Pure social networks like Twitter offer ways to
organize communities but don&#8217;t provide the structure
and tools needed for effective collaboration. They are mainly focus on
sharing.</p>

<p>While community organizing platforms provide a social layer they
also offer services geared towards the community itself. This
combination is what&#8217;s really valuable.
<a href="http://nationbuilder.com/">Nation Builder</a>
is the perfect example: it features volunteer organization, donation
monitoring, website creation&#8230; a comprehensive package
political leaders need to interact with their audience.</p>

<h2>Active communities are driven by knowledge</h2>

<p>We can distinguish communities built upon friendship, professional
activity or common interests. The most active
are the ones based on a common interest, where knowledge and
feedback is a valuable resource. In these ones people spend a lot of time
looking for information. They also create a lot of content in order to
improve their reputation. Such platforms are even more
important for small communities because the resources they want to access are not always well
indexed by search engines.</p>

<p>As sharing information, working collaboratively and giving feedbacks to peers is key in
these communities even a very little one
can be very active.
There is still lots of
them to structure out there, lots of people waiting to
share and collaborate with their peers. Who are they? What can we do for
them?</p>
