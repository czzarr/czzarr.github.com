  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>France&#8217;s higher education trains world-class engineers, but is home to very few successful start-ups. Having studied engineering in France and then at Stanford University, I will try to explain this apparent paradox.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/billselak/2417001179/"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2168/2417001179_d5ce2d9362_m.jpg" alt="Test taking" /></a>

<h2>Party hard, study a bit, get straight As</h2>

<p>When I took my first classes at Stanford University, I was very
surprised by the difficulty level of engineering classes. My French friends and I found the material to be straightforward, the assignments and exams were easy and the grading more than forgiving. We would party a lot, study a bit, and still get close to 4.0 GPAs. Simply put, we thought we were on top of the world. Of course, we were wrong.</p>

<h2>The hard reality</h2>

<p>But then we took an entrepreneurship class (&#8220;hey, how hard can that
be ?&#8221;), and the professor asked us who had already created a company.
&#8220;What a joke, who creates a company at 22 ?&#8221; was the question that
crossed my mind. But three quarters of the class raised their hand,
and we realized that we were indeed not at the top of the world.</p>

<h2>Hone your test-taking skills</h2>

<p>If you are not French, you probably don&#8217;t know anything about its arcane
higher education, and you can read <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1292">this PhD comic</a>
for a very good introduction. To sum it up, there is only one way to be part of the academic elite after high school,
and it is to enter the <em>&#8220;prepa&#8221;</em>, a two years long very intensive cursus at the end of which you take a competitive exam and get into the best school
(<em>&#8220;grande ecole&#8221;</em>) your rank enables you to. Once you get into one of these, you are assured you will easily land
one of the best/most well-paid jobs available.</p>

<p>There are good points to this system. It teaches us rigor, hard
work, how to handle pressure and a lot about theoretical science. But what we learn
best is how to do well at tests. And since it is so hard,
people from this system are still very proud of their
achievement 20 years later.</p>

<h2>&#8220;I can do it!&#8221;</h2>

<p>Basically in France, a lot of people believe that we can measure an
individual&#8217;s skills by how well he fared in a test 20 years ago. We tend
to favorably view people with a perfect pedigree: the best school, and
then a job at an elite consulting or investment-banking firm. Trying to create a start-up but failing is
not well preceived at all.</p>

<p>Americans are very different. They believe that you should use the most
recent achievements to judge a person&#8217;s skills, and that if you try, you
can do it. Where many a Frenchman would not even try for fear of failing,
Americans believe that success is inevitably down the road. And so
they try. And so they end up winning.</p>

<h2>The best of both worlds</h2>

<p>I don&#8217;t think the French system is inherently bad. It produces very good engineers with a strong Math background that is useful to become a good coder. But it is time we stopped having this &#8220;everything is a test&#8221;
mentality, and understand that <strong>failing is not necessarily a bad thing, if you seriously
tried</strong>. Thinking like this would radically change the French start-up
ecosystem: not only would we have more entrepreneurs, but also less
risk-adverse investors, and more ambitious ideas.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my <a href="http://needforair.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-synchronous-communicatio-70441" title="last article">last article</a>
I detailed why synchronous communication is not
appropriate for work: it leads to interruptions, involves moving or
shouting, drifts and leaves no trace.<br/>
To solve this communication problem I believe in the asynchronous way of
doing it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/68346521@N08/6370949347/"><img src="http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6052/6370949347_a66d54d217_m.jpg" alt="Carrier Pigeon" /></a>

<h2>Asynchronous?</h2>

<p>WTF is this? In an asynchronous communication
interlocutors can exchange and continue their discussion
whenever they want it. Examples of
asynchronous communication media are letter, text message, email,
chat. They all share a common something in common: they are <strong>written communication
media</strong>.</p>

<h2>Asynchronous Channels Are Superior</h2>

<p>The massive use of text messages illustrates the <strong>usefulness and the
advantages an asynchronous communication offers over an oral conversation.</strong>
It&#8217;s quick, efficient, you can respond hours later and  keep track of the history.
You should use different asynchronous communication media for different usecases. Your day-to-day conversation?
Do it by chat. A code review? Use Github and Pull Requests. Important annoucements? Write an email. Organize
your communication and insert it in your workflow. Segmenting your communication will help you manage it efficiently
and will diminish the pressure of a single overloaded inbox.</p>

<h2>Why Does Email Kill Your Productivity?</h2>

<p>At work, people seem to use email as the sole form of asynchronous communication. Emails are adapted for
internal communication like <strong>reports, formal announcements</strong>. If you write less-than-two-lines emails
you are doing it wrong. Do you really need an email to say <em>&#8220;Ok I&#8217;ll do it&#8221;</em> or <em>&#8220;Thanks&#8221;</em>?
For everyday use they are counter productive. You end up receiving tons
of emails a day, <strong>spending hours responding, deleting and archiving.</strong></p>

<h2>The Right Communication Medium: the Chat Room</h2>

<p>Setting up a chat room for your team is probably one of the most important
action you can do to improve its efficiency and productivity.
90% of its communication should occur there. With a chat room solution
<strong>conversations history is easily accessible, you can simultaneously participate to
multiple groups of discussions, sending a message is so much easier</strong>! Aren&#8217;t you bored of
clicking <em>New Message</em>, filling in recipients addresses? Even clicking on <em>Respond</em>
is painful.<br/>
Chat rooms are really the most adequate medium to communicate for your team.
<a href="http://needforair.com/why-you-shouldnt-use-synchronous-communicatio-70441" title="Previous post">Even</a>
if you work at the same place.</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t waste more time and set up your private chat room.</strong>
<a href="http://www.hipchat.com" title="HipChat">HipChat</a> is a great tool for that.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a recent <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/bruceupbin/2011/12/13/five-new-management-metrics-you-need-to-know/" title="Article">post</a>,
James Slavet (Greylock Partners) describes metrics we should consider to
be more productive. The top one is called Flow State Percentage and
measures the relative time we are deeply concentrated on what we are doing. Flow state has
an amazing impact on development cycles times. A big threat to flow state lies in synchronous communication.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hand-nor-glove/1226209342/"><img src="http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1209/1226209342_ad08767199_m.jpg" alt="Muzzle" /></a>

<h2>Synchronous communication?</h2>

<p>Synchronous forms of communication include face
to face conversation or phone discussion.
Synchronous because people talking do it at the
same exact moment: ever tried answering your colleagues
2 minutes or 1 hour after they asked you a question? That&#8217;s impossible
as oral conversations don&#8217;t work with delay.
Asynchronous communication solves that problem
by relies on a written exchange.</p>

<h2>What for?</h2>

<p>Oral conversations are <strong>only appropriate when a written exchange could take
much longer than it should</strong>: conflict resolution, detailed
explanation of a topic, etc. For other situations
synchronous communication is counter-productive.</p>

<h2>The pitfalls of synchronous communication at work</h2>

<p>For your everyday work conversations you should think twice
before having an oral discussion. Why? Here are <strong>4 reasons</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Oral discussion = interruption</strong> When somebody
asks you something it drains all your attention. You have to switch your
focus to provide the adequate answer which means you lose all the
concentration you had in your work.
The ten-seconds question becomes a ten-minutes perturbation, taking into
account the time you need to refocus (if you even manage to refocus)
and recall what your were doing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>It involves moving and/or shouting in the office</strong>. Depending on
your work office configuration talking with somebody means moving to his
desk or shouting through the open space. In the former case it
magnifies your work interruption. In the latter case you&#8217;ll manage
to effectively disturb everyone of your coworkers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fatally you drift</strong> Oral conversations drift more than
a bobsleigh on ice. Have you ever started a conversation about
the crucial decision you should take and ended up speaking of the last
hilarious meme you read?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Exchanges are lost for the posterity</strong> Oral conversations are not actionable, for you
or your teammates. What if you need to recall all the points
stated? How do you keep track of the history of your conversation?
What if the following week you&#8217;ll have the same question?
Won&#8217;t you feel bad disturbing your colleagues again?</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Before engaging in any kind of communication there is one thing
you should try: <strong>find an answer by yourself</strong>.
But sometimes it&#8217;s more efficient
to ask for somebody&#8217;s help instead of googling to find the appropriate
answer. In that case <strong>go for asynchronous communication.</strong></p>

<p>In a later post I&#8217;ll cover asynchronous communication
especially the pitfalls of emails and the benefits of having a chat room
for your team.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A maker is someone who likes to make stuff, to build things. It can be
an artist, a craftsman, an architect, a designer. But it can also be a
software developer. I&#8217;m talking about good developers. Those that take
pride in their work.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aidanmorgan/2331754875/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3140/2331754875_e6a2a81429_m.jpg" alt="Carrier Pigeon" /></a>
<em><a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0" title="license">CC license</a> - by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/24742305@N00/" title="Author">John-Morgan</a></em></p>

<h2>How we work</h2>

<p>Often times, people ask me how we work, how we manage things, and more
generally how software should be managed. And my response always
suprises them: no deadlines, <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch07_Meetings_Are_Toxic.php">no meetings</a>, we just make stuff as we go.</p>

<h2>Why French project managers mostly do it wrong</h2>

<p>In France most people think
software is a commodity, meaning they try to find the cheapest person
out there that will do the job. If your site is selling socks, that&#8217;s
probaly a decent bet because their isn&#8217;t a lot of technology involved
and your core business is selling socks, not your website.</p>

<p>So the problem with that thinking is that the premise is utterly wrong.
Good software is not a commodity, it comes at a price and not
everyone can do it. Even people who sell <a href="http://dollarshaveclub.com">shaving kits</a> have figured that
out.</p>

<h2>Let your artists work for you</h2>

<p>My point is good developers are not mere factory workers. They are elite
craftsmen or even artists, and they should be managed as such. Craftsmen
and artists can&#8217;t measure their work by the hour, they can&#8217;t follow a
well-defined schedule, you can&#8217;t tell them what are the priorities. They
will figure it out by themselves! Just let them work. If a bug needs to
be fixed, they will fix it because they care about the quality of their
code.</p>

<h2>Productivity cannot be commanded</h2>

<p>Developers, like artists, need to get &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psycholog%29">in the zone</a>)&#8221; in order to be
productive. You can&#8217;t make them get in the zone, you let them do it. So
stop handing them a todolist lovingly prioritised with strict deadlines,
it is useless. They are makers, they will work becauses they like what
they do and they love building things. There is no need to tell them to
do it. And if they want to work from 3pm to 3am because that&#8217;s when they
are the most productive, let them.</p>
