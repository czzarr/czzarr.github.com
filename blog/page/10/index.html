  <div class="entry-content"><p>A maker is someone who likes to make stuff, to build things. It can be
an artist, a craftsman, an architect, a designer. But it can also be a
software developer. I&#8217;m talking about good developers. Those that take
pride in their work.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/aidanmorgan/2331754875/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3140/2331754875_e6a2a81429_m.jpg" alt="Carrier Pigeon" /></a>

<h2>How we work</h2>

<p>Often times, people ask me how we work, how we manage things, and more
generally how software should be managed. And my response always
suprises them: no deadlines, <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch07_Meetings_Are_Toxic.php">no meetings</a>, we just make stuff as we go.</p>

<h2>Why French project managers mostly do it wrong</h2>

<p>In France most people think
software is a commodity, meaning they try to find the cheapest person
out there that will do the job. If your site is selling socks, that&#8217;s
probaly a decent bet because their isn&#8217;t a lot of technology involved
and your core business is selling socks, not your website.</p>

<p>So the problem with that thinking is that the premise is utterly wrong.
Good software is not a commodity, it comes at a price and not
everyone can do it. Even people who sell <a href="http://dollarshaveclub.com">shaving kits</a> have figured that
out.</p>

<h2>Let your artists work for you</h2>

<p>My point is good developers are not mere factory workers. They are elite
craftsmen or even artists, and they should be managed as such. Craftsmen
and artists can&#8217;t measure their work by the hour, they can&#8217;t follow a
well-defined schedule, you can&#8217;t tell them what are the priorities. They
will figure it out by themselves! Just let them work. If a bug needs to
be fixed, they will fix it because they care about the quality of their
code.</p>

<h2>Productivity cannot be commanded</h2>

<p>Developers, like artists, need to get &#8221;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_%28psycholog%29">in the zone</a>)&#8221; in order to be
productive. You can&#8217;t make them get in the zone, you let them do it. So
stop handing them a todolist lovingly prioritised with strict deadlines,
it is useless. They are makers, they will work becauses they like what
they do and they love building things. There is no need to tell them to
do it. And if they want to work from 3pm to 3am because that&#8217;s when they
are the most productive, let them.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Facebook notifications, Twitter feeds, RSS feeds, emails, news
aggregators and now so much
more. We are constantly hit by new information, throughout the day, and
the night. There are so many things we want to read or watch.
The fact that the Web is a strictly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a> application (or should I say
<a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2012-02-13-an-api-ontology">Hypermedia</a>) doesn&#8217;t help because one link usually leads to more links. I&#8217;m sure
you&#8217;ve already experienced having more than 20 tabs open in your browser
and thinking &#8221;<em>God, when am I going to read all of this?</em>&#8221; but instead
of starting reading you scan the links of the page in front of you and
just open more tabs. And this was only made worse by tools such as
<a href="http://instapaper.com" title="Instapaper">Instapaper</a> that make you feel good
about saving stuff for later, even if you know deep inside you&#8217;ll never
come back to it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/martinofranchi/2925760927/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3244/2925760927_a9db10926e_m.jpg" alt="Information overload" /></a></p>

<h2>Current solutions</h2>

<p>It&#8217;s extremely hard to keep up with all that information, and you
basically have 3 options at the moment:</p>

<h4>Let loose</h4>

<p>Accept that you can&#8217;t follow it all and if something is really important
it will come back to you one way or another so that missing it the first
time is not a big deal.
I personnally don&#8217;t like this solution because it means giving up
control on what I read and learn, and it basically amounts to a random
filter with some bias towards the most important news that isn&#8217;t always
the most interesting.</p>

<h4>Algorithmic filters</h4>

<p>Use tools such as <a href="http://news.me" title="News.me">News.me</a> or <a href="http://focus.io" title="Focus.io">Focus.io</a> that
use machine learning techniques to serve you the stories you might be
interested in the most. However, again, not knowing how these algorithms
work exactly, I fear I am going to lose the serendipity of scanning
myself all the input and selecting the hidden little gem that would be
considered as noise by these algorithms. Again, I hate losing control. I
do think these are better solutions than just letting loose.</p>

<h4>Reducing the input</h4>

<p>This for me is the best alternative. Following sort of a <em>less is more</em> convention,
I am looking to reduce the number of sources rather than increasing it,
keeping only the outstanding ones. I am constantly reevaluating the
quality of the twitter accounts and bloggers I follow in order to remove
those that either tweet too much  or whose content quality has suffered.
I am very rarely looking for new people to follow, and when I try
someone new it is always an experiment, never set in stone. I&#8217;d actually
like it if an algorithm could do that for me, again, not knowing the
inner workings of the services that offer news recommendation is too
bad. I&#8217;m willing to bet none of them though is going to unfollow someone
on twitter for you, or experiment with a new follower, based on the
quality of the links provided in the tweets. Same for RSS feeds.</p>

<h2>We need a new tool to find good content</h2>

<p>Basically none of today&#8217;s tools are good at finding good news and
information. You can use a combination of tools (such as <a href="http://quora.com" title="Quora">Quora</a> and <a href="http://stackexchange.com" title="StackEchange">StackExchange</a> but it is more
difficult than one tool and is conducive to a lot of noise. Plus we are
missing a linking tool between content of the same nature and topics,
that would transcend time. There are services like <a href="http://delicious.com" title="Delicious">Delicious</a> that you
can browse by searching for tags, but it is not powerful enough in the
way it presents the information. There are still too many links and not
enough clues as to which are interesting and which are not.</p>

<p>But don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;re working on it ;)</p>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nireyal">@nireyal</a> - Feb 26, 2012</em></p>

<p><em>Nir Eyal describes the importance of habits besides virality for the
success of products in the Curated Web</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Habits are what matters. Web businesses success increasingly depends on the strength of their users&#8217; habitual behavior</li>
<li>Web 1.0 companies measured success by pageviews and CPM, whereas new (social) companies proved  to be valuable because they were habit-forming (hot triggers, variable rewards, regular check-in&#8230;)</li>
<li>At the dawn of the Curated Web, companies must build habit creation into their products and business models. Not only are users inundated by distractions, but acquiring users is also harder than ever before</li>
<li>Companies which successfully create user habits can build huge enterprises, even without viral growth (Evernote, Amazon)</li>
<li>The more the user engages with a Curated Web company, the more data the company has to tailor and improve the user&rsquo;s experience. This self-improving feedback loop has the potential to be more useful &ndash; and more addictive &mdash; than anything we&rsquo;ve seen before</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Page performance data in (near) real-time rather than on average 48 hour delay could enable businesses to reach higher ROIs</li>
<li>Immediate &ldquo;people talking about this&rdquo; data could give marketers a sense of a post&rsquo;s virality, and indicate if they should modify the content or the apps they link to</li>
<li>&ldquo;Insights API give Page owners an opportunity to see how their Page actually lives and breathes&rdquo;.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s up to us as tool developers to turn that data into something awesome and present it in relevant actionable analytics.&rdquo;</li>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jordankurzweil">@JordanKurzweil</a> - Feb 25, 2012</em></p>

<p><em>Jordan Kurzweil describes the context of &ldquo;digital magazination&rdquo; of content. He states some recommendations to straighten up print business. At the heart of his reflexion is personalized and curated content</em></p>

<ul>
<li>PRINT IS DEAD. revenue, subscriptions and circulation are declining</li>
<li>What can Old Print do to survive? Stop rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, grow a pair, and change your business model:

<ul>
<li>Accept this evolution (aging and fragmentation of audience, concurrency from other digital media &#8230;) and embrace it</li>
<li>Start thinking like startups: use some of your profits to incubate new ideas (e.g. Washington post personalized headlines)</li>
<li>Rethink your organization : everyone should be a doer, contributing 100 percent of her/his work hours to making things</li>
<li>Stop thinking that technology serves content: they are now one and the same, each working with the other to delight and engage your users</li>
<li>Update web platforms</li>
<li>Use data to inform your editorial and product decisions</li>
<li>Break down the wall between editors, writers and readers</li>
<li>Consider your content as a currency, not the end-all be-all but a means to an end</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When working on a project we always face repetitive tasks. But we shouldn&#8217;t have to spend as much time on those tasks as we usually do. We love
to think: &#8221;<em>I just have to do it once and I won&#8217;t have to do it again</em>&#8221; But we never have to do it only once, be it for the current project or
the next one.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1073/1352003098_1681416c2d_m.jpg" title="Keyboard" alt="Illustration" /></p>

<p><strong>Automate by scripting</strong><br/>
Task repetition can be solved in a painless way: scripting. When you don&#8217;t automate repetitive work you waste time. We should always see mechanical tasks as potential scripts. It&#8217;s only
because we tend to procrastinate and we don&#8217;t face this reality that we
postpone the moment we start scripting.</p>

<p><strong>Save your time</strong><br/>
I think scripting is a very important activity, above
all because it makes us save a lot of time. The inputs changed? No problem, just
rerun the script and you&#8217;re done.</p>

<p><strong>Ship a product</strong><br/>
I love scripting because a script is something concrete and useful. By writing our custom
script we <em>&#8220;scratch our own itch&#8221;</em>, we solve our own problem with our
own technical skills, which always provides an immense satisfaction. Coding a script is like shipping a
small product!</p>

<p>In addition, it helps us develop and extend our programming
skills. It improves our knowledge of the scripting language and it makes us
discover API wrappers.</p>

<p><strong>Do it right</strong><br/>
When working in a team, scripting is even more useful. It&#8217;s
more than likely that our teamates will have to do later whar we are doing now. On top of that, scripting for a team forces us
to write good quality code because our users are our teammates. They
won&#8217;t be as indulgent as we are regarding our work, we don&#8217;t want them
to think that we are poor coders, so we do it right.</p>

<p><strong>Improve creativity and productivity</strong><br/>
The next time you think &#8220;it would be so nice to automate this work&#8221;, spend some time to look for a scripting solution ! The more you script the better you will become at it. So take some time thinking about what you are doing, you will see
how it improves your creativity and your productivity.</p>
