  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the past years, we have seen a lot of developped countries
governments pushing for more regulation of the Internet, and less
privacy for users. There are three main reasons: protection of
children, prevention of terrorism and <a href="http://needforair.com/blog/2012/03/29/sopa-hadopi-future-of-culture/">fight against illegal downloading</a>. This has led to very repressive and usually inefficient laws, for example in Australia, in France (Hadopi) and <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/220181-dodd-says-sopa-can-live-again">possibly soon</a> in the US. I think that a big part of this problem is that a very large portion of the people making these laws understand next to nothing about the Internet, and are thus afraid of it. What can we do about it?</p>

<h2>Direct education is not enough</h2>

<p>Direct education is the most natural answer. Initiatives like Google&#8217;s
<a href="http://www.20thingsilearned.com/en-US">20 things I learned about browsers and the Web</a> for example, aim at explaining very simply the basics to beginners. More focused initiatives like the <a href="http://www.eg8forum.com/en/">electronic G8 forum</a>, which was held last year in Paris are interesting too. But unfortunately, none of these will make a real impact as long as politicians have so little interest for this world. What we really need is to make them <strong>want</strong> to learn about the Internet.</p>

<h2>The Pirate Party can play a significant role</h2>

<p>What politicians really care about is of course to get (re)elected. And
since they are busy people, they only tackle the subjects they feel are the
most importants for voters, which are nowadays the economic crisis and
unemployment. This is where I think the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Party">Pirate Party</a> has a huge role to play. Even though they are still a fringe party today, they <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/20/world/europe/in-berlin-pirates-win-8-9-percent-of-vote-in-regional-races.html">have had some electoral success</a> and have shown the political world that voters do care about Internet-related issues. If they continue to be successful, I am pretty sure that mainstream politicians, who hold the real power, will want to understand the Internet better, leading to a more fruitful public debate.</p>

<p>It will surely take some time, but I think <strong>it will happen</strong>, because it already happened in the past: 30 years ago, neither voters nor politicians cared about the environment, and the Green parties were regarded the same way the Pirate party is today. Now, ecology is a significant political topic in many European countries. The Internet is next.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As Stanislas explained in <a href="http://needforair.com/blog/2012/03/09/how-to-keep-up-with-the-information-overload/" title="Information Overload">this previous post</a>, we believe we are dealing with too much information to keep up on the Internet. The natural solution is text summarization, and computers can help us there.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/xeeliz/3558255554/sizes/l/in/photostream/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3376/3558255554_9f9c480132_n.jpg" alt="Summary" /></a>
<em>by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/xeeliz/" title="Author">Xeeiliz</a></em></p>

<p>There are roughly two kinds of summaries: the ones that consist of a few of
the most important sentences extracted from the text, the keyphrases, and the ones that
are written from scratch without necessarily using the same phrasing, called abstract summaries.</p>

<h2>Finding the most relevant content: keyphrase extraction</h2>

<p>The big advantage of keyphrase-based summaries is that there is no risk
of miscomprehension since they are composed of unrephrased pieces of the
text. Moreover, computers are able to compute them and get decent
results. There are two main ways to do it: supervised and unsupervised
extraction.</p>

<h3>When you know the context: extraction as supervised learning</h3>

<p>One way to perform this task is described by Peter Turney in <a href="http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~lindek/650/papers/turney.pdf">this paper</a>. He found that using a custom-designed algorithm that incorporates specialized domain knowledge on a text generates yields very good results: 80% of keyphrases are deemed acceptable by human readers. The problem with this approach is that it requires the computer to know the topic beforehand. It is possible to use a prior first step to determine what it is, but this is difficult and the results are terrible if we get it wrong.</p>

<h3>Applicable to any text: unsupervised keyphrase extraction</h3>

<p>This approaches enables us to extract keyphrases from a text without any
prior knowledge, which is a tremendous improvement upon the previous method. There a several algorithms, and one notable current example is <a href="http://www.summly.com/">Summly</a>. I will explain one of those, named TextRank, to give you a feeling of the kind of techniques used in this field.</p>

<p>The TextRank algorithm was developped by Rada Mihalcea and Paul Tarau in
<a href="http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/acl2004/emnlp/pdf/Mihalcea.pdf">this paper</a>. The key idea is that a text
unit (word or phrase depending on the need) that is close to a lot of other important text units is likely a keyphrase. Using the parallel between the &#8220;close to&#8221; relation and the &#8220;referred to by&#8221; relation of hyperlinks, TextRank uses Google&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a> to determine which text units are the most important. It works well, its main author was even awarded a $100k grant by Google for her work on keyphrase extraction.</p>

<h2>The best: abstract summarization</h2>

<p>Even though they can be very useful, keyphrase-based summaries are still
rudimentary compared to abstract summaries, because they are much nicer
to read, and we are sure no important information was &#8220;left behind&#8221; (i.e a keyphrase was not extracted). Also, keyphrase extraction algorithms still find it hard to
summarize technical articles.</p>

<p>Abstract summarization is the limit of what computers can do today. The
main reason for this is that they struggle with the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Coreferences understanding</strong>. For example, who does &#8216;he&#8217;
references in the sentence &#8216;Paul told John he should play squash&#8217;?</li>
<li><strong>Word sense disambiguation</strong>. In &#8216;I need batteries for
my mouse&#8217;, are we talking about the animal or the device?</li>
<li><strong>Sentiment analysis</strong>. Understanding the mood of the writer is often
key to understanding a text, all the more when there is sarcasm.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Computers can help humans summarize a text</h2>

<p>To sum it up, I believe that humans still cannot be replaced by
algorithms if we want to produce quality summaries. Nonetheless, a
computer really can help a us by providing a keyphrase-based summary,
so that we spend less time scanning the text for them. In addition, if
we were able to train algorithms by comparing their output with a human
summary a lot of times for articles on a certain topic, I think it is possible we see significant improvements.</p>

<p><em>Note: some examples were taken from <a href="https://class.coursera.org/nlp/">Stanford&#8217;s Natural Language
Processing online class</a>. If you couldn&#8217;t take
it this quarter, look for it, it is a terrific place to learn about this
topic</em></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Albert Wenger is right:
<a href="http://continuations.com/post/20112755144/students-are-woefully-prepared-for-internet-age-job">we are woefully prepared for internet age job market</a>.
The three of us graduated in Computer Science in college, following a solid
engineering cursus. But during the
numerous courses we took we never heard of <a href="http://github.com/">Github</a> nor <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>.
People attending creative and artistic
formation don&#8217;t hear of <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a> neither.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7044/7046351459_53d8ed3283.jpg" alt="Jeff Atwood" /></p>

<p>You could argue: &#8220;What&#8217;s the problem with that? You aren&#8217;t supposed to learn
how to use these platforms in school but core skills in your field!&#8221;</p>

<p>But that would be missing a point. The education we all receive has one final
goal: be prepared to get the best job as possible. In our current
era <strong>finding a job doesn&#8217;t come down to respond to job offers by sending
cover letters and resume</strong> nor spam by email all our contacts in the industry
to get an interview.</p>

<p>We are lucky to live through the emergence and the
expansion of specialized platforms which can help us build our personal
and professional identity. With these platforms <strong>we can easily have a
professional visibility, expose our skills so they can be assessed by
everyone and acquire real experience with real work.</strong></p>

<p>The very first recommendation we should receive beginning a course in
a topic is registering on all the platforms related to this topic. The
professors should foster us to leverage these platform to develop our
skills, build our expertise and gain some fame. Such platforms work this way: they play with
our ego to encourage us to contribute more and more and make our
achievements visible for everyone in return. <strong>They are built to be our showcase</strong> and
we should take advantage of it. We do so many interesting projects in
school, sometimes state of the art implementations in CS, that get lost
on our machine. They should be public to catch recruiters&#8217; attention on
our profile and skills or help us <a href="http://cdixon.org/2012/02/26/the-internet-is-reshaping-our-economy-from-one-of-huge-corporations-with-lots-of-jobs-to-huge-platforms-with-lots-of-income-streams/">create our future income streams</a>.</p>

<p>So at which level can we improve the promotion of such platforms? At the school&#8217;s level?
At the professors&#8217; level? They should all keep up with the internet economy like they
usually keep up with the <em>real</em> economy. Schools should increase professors&#8217; awareness, who
are mainly researchers in engineering schools for example, to this
concern but it&#8217;s up to the professors to promote personaly the right
platforms. Professors do already a great job teaching us their
knowledge, <strong>they should go further and encourage us to capitalize on their
teaching</strong>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Search is a behavior, it is what people do when they want to find
something and don&#8217;t know exactly what they&#8217;re looking for, or when they
know what they&#8217;re looking for but don&#8217;t know where to find it.
But search on computers or on the web has traditionally been either
intuitive and useless or unintuitive and powerful, as I&#8217;m going to show
you.
Even searching on Google used to be <a href="http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2003/10/search.html">hard and
unintuitive</a>
for the layperson. But Google improved the UX and it was so
powerful that people just learned to use it.</p>

<p>Until now
search was basically equated to Google (a single-entry point to all of
the resources available on the web), but with the major
<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/03/welcome-to-the-post-pc-era.html">shift</a> from computers to mobile devices,
search UX needs to be reinvented.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/37161567@N04/6751892711/"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7143/6751892711_f59c0452e8.jpg" alt="Siri helps Doggy" /></a>

<h2>Fact: Mobile Search User Experience Sucks</h2>

<p>Searching on smartphones is currently a terrible user experience. Screens are
tiny, typos frequent, missclicks incredibly annoying. Search results
don&#8217;t account well for the fact that smartphones are not simply smaller versions of
computers. Recently for instance, an <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/bw/app/quickmaps/id506283203?mt=8">iphone app</a> that is a
simple user interface for frequent
Google Maps queries received a very positive feedback and was an instant
success.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why most search on mobile is done on vertically differentiated
apps: one searches for places to stay on the Airbnb app, and looks for movies on the IMDB
app. These apps provide a better search experience, from the query to
the results &#8220;page&#8221;. The problem with that scheme is when you don&#8217;t know
the particular app that suits your needs. Unless you follow Techcrunch
or HackerNews religiously it can get tricky. The beauty of Google and
other search engines was that they provided a single entry point for web
content. You didn&#8217;t have to know anything else, and a lot of people
still google &#8220;facebook&#8221; to reach the facebook website.</p>

<p>But the UX of single entry point search is so bad on mobile that people
don&#8217;t bother using it. Instead they&#8217;re left with discovering content
through social media apps which offer a very decent UX for that. But they
cannot look for something from a single-entry point unless they muster
enough courage to deal with Google&#8217;s web app, and that&#8217;s too bad.</p>

<h2>Lets Go Back In Time</h2>

<p>When Windows arrived on the market, it represented a major shift in UX.
Before Windows, people interacted with computers using a command-line
interface(CLI), otherwise known as the shell. Command-line means that instead
of clicking around, navigating in your folders and moving files
visually, you gave a command to the computer and it executed your
command. The CLI was (and still is) a great UX for search of files in a
computer. Windows&#8217; graphical user interface, on the other hand, was absolutely terrible at this.</p>

<p>Can you remember when you still had Windows? Looking for a file was
absurdly hard and difficult, borderline impossible. That&#8217;s why most
people just used their brain to remember where they put their files on
their hard drive, and went looking for it by opening folder after
folder. So Windows was a huge regression in search UX from the days when there was no graphical
interface.</p>

<p>Windows was arguably more intuitive than the CLI, you didn&#8217;t have to
learn any commands to use it. All you had to do is click buttons and move your cursor
around. But as you gained intuitiveness, you lost the power of the CLI.</p>

<p>The reason why I&#8217;m talking about
all this is we are currently witnessing a similar change of paradigms
as websites are becoming webapps or even native mobile apps, that cannot
be cleanly separated into different pages anymore. And again search UX
is getting the bitter end of the deal.</p>

<p>Apps are more intuitive, there are no more files, no more links, it&#8217;s
pure visual and intuition heaven such that 2-year olds are comfortable with iPads,
but powerful search is not part of the experience.</p>

<h2>Enters Siri</h2>

<p>Siri is the new personal assistant that lives in all iPhones 4S. You
talk to her and she executes your wishes to the best of her abilities.</p>

<p>A lot of people say it&#8217;s a gadget, it&#8217;s not actionable,
it&#8217;s an Apple marketing ploy to sell you an iPhone 4 at a 20% premium. I
think however that it&#8217;s much more than that and that these critics are
missing the elephant in the room. For me, Siri is the new
command-line interface.</p>

<p>Think about what Siri does. You ask her to set your
alarm, to give you the weather, to find a restaurant, to look for places, all from a single entry point.
Basically, it&#8217;s a <strong>vocal recognition enabled command interface</strong>.
And even though it&#8217;s still rough on the
edges, I&#8217;m positive it&#8217;s going to become much more powerful in the near
future. Vocal commands are the ultimate user experience, everybody gets
it. The sole interface that beat vocal commands would be a mind-reading
interface.
So for the first time we have a <strong>search UX that is both intuitive
and powerful</strong> (or promising to be at least). Siri is abstracting links
and complicated queries from the end-user. Most people don&#8217;t care about
links, they just want the data, the resource that the links point to.</p>

<p>Siri is going to bring search back to mobile devices, and make search a
huge part of the mobile ecosystem once it opens its API to developers.</p>
