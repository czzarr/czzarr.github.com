  <div class="entry-content"><p>The entertainment industry is busy trying to make the US adopt the SOPA
law which is considered dangerous for the Internet by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/jan/18/sopa-wikipedia-blackout-google-reddit" title="many">many</a>. This brings two questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What can the future model for accessing culture look like? Will today&#8217;s
giants be part of it?</li>
<li>How can we ensure that laws are made by people with sufficient
knowledge of the field they try to regulate?</li>
</ul>


<p>I give my consumer and tech enthusiast point of view on the first question in this post and I will tackle the second one in a few days.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/27539822@N05/3697785107/"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2608/3697785107_579dac8a0f_n.jpg" alt="Concert" /></a>
<em>by <a href="http://www.christianholmer.com/" title="Author">Christian Holmer</a></em></p>

<h2>How the Internet disrupted the entertainment industry&#8217;s business model</h2>

<p>The major movie and music producers (Hollywood, Sony, Universal to name a few) engage in the <a href="http://musicfacts2.wordpress.com/2010/06/25/15-analysis-of-the-cost-structure/">following activities</a>: content production (recording in the case of music), royalties payments to artists and copyrights holders,  marketing and promotion, purchase, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution. The first four can be referred to as &#8220;creating the content and making it known&#8221;, and the Internet didn&#8217;t have much impact on them.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the last four (&#8220;bringing the content to consumers&#8221;), have been completely disrupted by the arrival of the Internet, which brings these costs close to zero. In my opinion, the major labels have failed to accept this fact, which is why they took such a long time to open downloading services. And even then, the online prices have not gone down by as much as they could. They may have every right to tell consumers that they always have the option not to get music/videos, but I think that&#8217;s not a <a href="http://www.marco.org/2012/02/25/right-vs-pragmatic" title="pragmatic">pragmatic approach</a>. I want to listen to music and watch movies, but I don&#8217;t like to pay for CDs that are DRM-locked, or for a zone 1 DVD that only works in 2 countries and begins with an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWPfcEOr2Yg" title="Bender piracy warning">&#8220;illegal downloading is ripping out a beating human heart&#8221; ad</a>. In fact, I don&#8217;t even want to have to drive to the nearest Virgin Megastore to get the latest season of Game of Thrones. <em>What I want is to be able to get access to music and videos freely from my home</em>.</p>

<h2>People still want to pay for what they love</h2>

<p>Does that mean that labels and artists are doomed to be left destitute as we all get their work for free? I really don&#8217;t think so. People (myself included) <em>want</em> to pay for what they love. For example, you can look at <a href="http://flattr.com/" title="Flattr">Flattr</a>. Or you can consider the fact that <a href="http://www.wired.com/listening_post/2007/10/estimates-radio/" title="Radiohead">Radiohead made between $6M and $10M from a
&#8220;pay-what-you-want&#8221; downloadable album</a>.</p>

<p>But what I love is music, movies, tv series. In a word, <em>culture</em>. Now that I&#8217;ve seen how easy it is to access it on the Internet, I want the paying offer to be at least as good as the free one: a large choice, fast downloads and unlimited access from anywhere. I am sick of DVDs rendered unreadable due to copy-protection (happened again last week), and music I can&#8217;t copy however I wish.</p>

<h2>How labels and artists can get paid</h2>

<p>In my opinion, a <em>global subscription model</em>, much like Spotify&#8217;s, would be a very nice solution. I estimate the number of Internet subscriptions in North America to be 80M (it was <a href="http://www.internetworldstats.com/am/us.htm">70M in the US alone in 2009</a>). The <a href="http://grabstats.com/statmain.asp?StatID=74">music industry made a total of $26.5B in the same region in 2011</a>, which corresponds to about $28 per subscribtion and per month. I share one subscription with my girlfriend whom I live with, so that means I would have to pay $14 per month for unlimited and legal music. I would do that gladly!</p>

<p>The exchanges could be
monitored so that the most downloaded artists receive more money than
the others. This redistribution system could also be tweaked in favor of smaller, unknown artists to support discovery.</p>

<p>The above only concerns personal content consumption. <em>There
are alternative revenue streams for artists and labels that cannot be copied nor downloaded</em>: concerts, movie theatres, goodies and so on. For example, <a href="http://grabstats.com/statmain.asp?StatID=73">the total 2011 revenue for live music in North America is $10.3B</a>. It seems to be enough to sustain music creation, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p><a href="http://needforair.com/blog/2012/03/26/we-are-all-nutcrackers/">In a nutshell</a>, I think that major labels still have a role to play, but should focus on content creation and marketing, where their true value addition resides. I fear that if they continue to try to keep the old business model in place, they will be replaced by more suited players.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><em>In a nutshell&#8230;</em> Have you never been looking for this expression
while reading an article? The fact is that we are all fond of digested
information. With Internet and social medias the quantity of information
one has access to has become huge; we are coping with an
<a href="http://needforair.com/information-overload-and-how-to-keep-up-with-5849" title="Overload">information overload problem</a>.
We can potentially be aware of everything that is going on everywhere, instantaneously
and regarding any topic. <strong>In this context, the demand for digested
information is growing tremendously.</strong><br/>
Recently, many startups have been leveraging that fondness to
succeed. <a href="http://www.fanbridge.com/" title="Fanbridge">Franbridge</a> with its
<a href="http://www.fanbridge.com/blog/introducing-social-digest" title="Social Digest">Social digest</a>
will soon reach <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/03/21/as-it-turns-out-fanbridges-most-exciting-product-is-boring-old-email/">10 millions subscribers</a>!<br/>
Why people do love and value digested information so much?</p>

<p><a href="http://freshcode.co/post/Nameservers-in-a-Nutshell-Fresh-Insights-7.aspx"><img src="http://freshcode.co/image.axd?picture=2011%2f7%2fnutshell.jpg" width="220" alt="Nutshell" /></a>

<h2>Digested information is our natural representation of information</h2>

<p>We all love digested information because it makes the information easy
to grasp.
It is very popular because it replicates the mental
process we do when reading. We look for headlines, bold text, headers,
we scan the text to form our overall picture of the content. Digested
information gathers all those clues and eases this process.<br/>
Part of this cognitive process is the memorisation. Digested information
makes memorisation more accessible. Remember those cheatsheets you
religiously wrote down for your exam preparation in college? Reading the digest of an
article has the same effect. When building our personal knowledge
database we store those keywords, key sentences. Digested information is
the natural form of information our brain manipulates when it internally
classifies, archives, queries our memory.</p>

<h2>Digested information piques reader&#8217;s curiosity</h2>

<p>While reading we like it when the content arouses our curiosity. I would even say
that we expect an article to <em>catch</em> us. Digested information provides
the gist that drives us to the dive in the details. It avoids the wall of text effect and
stimulates our willingness to dig further into subject. It&#8217;s like reading gossips! You
get hooked and then you want to know more about it.</p>

<p>Digested information is a very valuable resource and its era should come soon.</p>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/roybahat">@roybahat</a> - Mar 16, 2012</em></p>

<p>Roy Bahat writes a follow up to Roger and Mike&#8217;s
<a href="http://rogerandmike.com/post/18870279638/what-is-the-hypernet" title="Hypernet">article on the Hypernet</a>.
He explains why business development may replace SEO in the next
Internet era.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Changes</strong>

<ul>
<li>the iPhone changed the internet, by taking us away from the SEO-driven world of URLs and websites</li>
<li>Search won’t come first. New services succeed without ever really needing to master search (Pinterest, Angry Birds etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>New perspectives</strong>

<ul>
<li>Some think social media optimization will replace search engine optimization but that&#8217;s not all</li>
<li>In the next era, you can get discovered merely by having a strong relationship with one of the platforms of discovery</li>
<li>Business development may take the place of SEO.  This could be great for companies with well-known brands based on a quality service</li>
<li>That’s awful for new services with great content but no way to get an <em>in</em> – but it’s great for wonderful brands who might otherwise have struggled with the strange world of search algorithms</li>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jmattheij">@jmattheij</a> - Mar 15, 2012</em></p>

<p>Jacques Mattheij thinks about the value of Google+ for Google and why
they are pushing it so hard. This article outlines a hypothetical way in which Google+ could be of major strategic value for Google in its core business, search.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The value of links is decreasing</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>People that relied on links will now rely on Google reducing the value of links between sites</li>
<li>People that realize that Google values links will create lots of them still further reducing the value of links between sites</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Why Google is promoting Google+</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>analytics + social network tells you what social circles are reading which articles</li>
<li>Someone that is professionally engaged in a certain field carefully studying an article in that same field is likely a good indicator that such an article is at least worthy of some notice</li>
<li>There is no algorithm as good at discriminating bad content from good content as the human mind</li>
<li>Every user in Google+ is actually now an unpaid Google employee whose actions are used to influence the google search results as a way to stop further erosion of the results due to spam</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>All three of us read a lot. Blogs, <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com" title="Hacker News">Hacker News</a>, links we get through
Twitter, etc. Browsing dozens of articles a week to stay informed is great but do we get the most out of it? <strong>Do we
actually memorize the gist of all that content we are reading?</strong> Spending
so much time reading would be a huge waste if it wasn&#8217;t consolidated in
some fashion. That&#8217;s why we decided to write summaries of the best
articles we find.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/60546721@N00/102673733/"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/42/102673733_39cbb51495_n.jpg" alt="Keep the gist" /></a>

<h2>It forces you to really understand what the article is about</h2>

<p>My Math and Physics professors would always say that the best way to learn
was to get to the point where you are able to
<strong>recap the course materials in writing</strong> (theroems, proofs, case studies).</p>

<p>In order to select the most critical parts of an article you need to
really read through the whole article and pick up the signal that you
want to remember. This means you should understand thoroughly what the
article is about and the author&#8217;s reasoning. Why she spent time on some
subject and not on others.</p>

<p>When writing up a summary, be it by mere copy/pasting or rephrasing, you put yourself
in an active cognitive process. You are not simply consuming
anymore, you are disecting and structuring information. Not only will
your memory be more deeply impressed than if you just read but it will
be more structured and organized.</p>

<h2>You can go back to it later</h2>

<p>Bookmarking is currently the only way of organizing and keeping up with the content that you
loved and that you would want to be able to find again later and share
to others via tools such as <a href="http://delicious.com" title="Delicious">Delicious</a>,
or <a href="http://pinboard.in" title="Pinboard">Pinboard</a>.
However you still need to reread the whole article once you go back to
it, which can be a waste of time in some cases. <a href="http://evernote.com" title="Evernote">Evernote</a> is better in that regard as
you make save notes on any topic.</p>

<p><strong>If you had summaries for each of your bookmarks</strong>, you could go back to
that content and filter it in a much more effective fashion, deciding
whether or not you want to delve into the whole article or not. It is
something between the title and the article that is missing to help you
filter through your bookmarks and consume your content.</p>

<p>We keep all of our digests in an organized way so that they are easily
searchable and consumable.</p>

<h2>Sharing becomes easier</h2>

<p>Digests also make it easier to share content. Ever tried to send a link
to someone, and never got any feedback? Chances are they
are receiving hundreds of links per day, by email, facebook, twitter, etc.
You&#8217;re asking that person for too much work. She doesn&#8217;t have enough time
to read yet another whole article without knowing it&#8217;s high quality content.</p>

<p><strong>If you include a short digest</strong> of the article or video or podcast in your
email, you can be sure there is a much higher chance that she reads the
digest and eventually clicks the link, intrigued. And you&#8217;ll be
able to have a conversation about it. That is sharing. Sending naked links is not sharing,
