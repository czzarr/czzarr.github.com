  <div class="entry-content"><p>After two months of effort, our book is finally out. The collaborative
writing process is extremely interesting in itself and will be the topic
of subsequent blog posts. For now, we&#8217;re happy to introduce <a href="http://leanpub.com/startupflow">Startup
Flow</a>, a guide to getting set up as a
small team starting to work on a new venture. It addresses questions
about <strong>how to communicate</strong> - especially when <strong>working remotely</strong>, <strong>how to
share knowledge</strong> and <strong>how to collaborate on a code base</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="http://leanpub.com/startupflow"><img src="http://titlepages.leanpub.com/startupflow/bookpage?1335536785" alt="Startup Flow" /></a></p>

<p>Here are some answers to some
questions you might have:</p>

<h2>Who Is this Book For?</h2>

<p>If you are a <strong>small team beginning a technical entrepreneurial project</strong>
and you are struggling to organize your workflow, especially if some of you are
working remotely, this book is for you. It was written with both business people and developers
in mind as they&#8217;ll need to use common tools, however there are some more <em>technical</em> chapters
which are marked as such so that business people can skip them.</p>

<h2>Why You Need this Book</h2>

<p>You need it because <strong>it will save you a ton of time and
make your workdays much more pleasant</strong>.
Indeed, when you start working on a startup you quickly realize that you are
going to need some tools to organize your workflow. Especially if you
have cofounders, you will find yourself meeting too often, repeating yourself,
having a hard time following what everyone is doing, and this will be
very frustrating for all of you.</p>

<p>In order to fix these problems, <strong>you&#8217;ll need to choose your tools and design an efficient workflow</strong> through trial and error. <strong>That
takes a lot of time</strong>, given how many tools there are and how hard it is to
discriminate between them without actually trying them. <strong>We already went through that process,
and we compiled our findings</strong> in this book so that you can skip that part and start getting things done with
 great tools that will boost your productivity. Moreover, reading this book will help understand your core needs, even those you aren&#8217;t aware of yet.</p>

<h2>What Is in this Book?</h2>

<p>This book is a collection of the <strong>opinionated choices</strong> we made.
We focused on what we think are the most important components of a
startup workflow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Knowledge sharing and reuse</li>
<li>Codebase management</li>
</ul>


<p>With these 3 themes in mind, we offer a selection of tools, one tool
for one problem. The tools that we promote are the ones that we use
extensively everyday and that we chose after weeks of iteration.
Furthermore, they work very well together. We will describe these
<strong>synergies</strong> at the end of the book, so that you can take full advantage
of this work environment.</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>Communication between teammates is a hard problem. It is necessary yet
so complicated to get right. A large portion of communication should be
asynchronous, enabling you to avoid useless interruptions that hurt your
and your teammates&#8217;
productivity. You also need to use different channels dedicated to different
use cases.</p>

<h3>Knowledge Sharing and Reuse</h3>

<p>All the knowledge that one finds interesting and usable should be
findable by the other teammates, without him having to send a link by
email or Skype every time. If knowledge is not shared or not reusable,
it&#8217;s worthless and you will lose a lot of time. This is especially true for
Eric Ries&#8217; <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/04/validated-learning-about-customers.html">validated learning</a>,
on which the whole team should be constantly focused.</p>

<h3>Codebase Management</h3>

<p>In a technical startup, coding is a vital activity. The developers need to
be able to code effectively on their own, but also to collaborate
seamlessly.
They need to be able to review one another&#8217;s code to ensure overall quality.
Teams that don&#8217;t do that will hit a wall.</p>

<p>If you do all these 3 things right, your team will be so efficient it will be
able to build the next Instagram in a week. No kidding!</p>

<h2>What this Book is Not</h2>

<p>This book is <strong>not</strong> a collection of tutorials. We will not guide you through the
process of installing and using everything in details. Instead we point you to quality
external resources.</p>

<p>It also doesn&#8217;t pretend to be the <em>be-all, end-all</em> guide on team
workflow for every case imaginable. However we feel it is the absolute
best for small teams working on a tech project, especially if the team
doesn&#8217;t have an office yet.</p>

<p>And, finally, it is not a startup guide. We won&#8217;t give you any advice as
to how to get your business off the ground, we&#8217;re not qualified for
that! If that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re looking for, we recommend Eric Ries&#8217; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous/dp/0307887898/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334839735&amp;sr=8-1"><em>The Lean Startup</em></a>, a must-read in our opinion.</p>

<h2>Why We Wrote this Book</h2>

<p>As we started working on ideas and on our startup, we faced the problem we
cited earlier. Our lack of organization was holding us back. So we spent
two weeks researching and trying different tools. After a
few iterations we finally reached a very efficient workflow and this investment
is now paying off big time. At first this was just an internal effort, but judging from the

<a href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-for-a-startup-distributed-team-to-handle-document-management">you</a>

<a href="http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-productivity-tools-for-entrepreneurs">find</a> on <a href="http://quora.com">Quora</a>,
we understood that many people could benefit from our research, and
so we decided to write this book.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I read a lot, probably an average of 15 blogposts a day and a book every
two weeks. I find that I sometimes have a lot of trouble
remembering the things I just read. Well it&#8217;s
usually not completely forgotten, the information is likely stored in my
unconscious brain and will trickle back to my consciousness when
somethings triggers it, such as a question or a situation that matches
the pattern my brain stored when I read said content. So that means I
just need a little prodding in order to remember. However there is I
think a more interesting question: how do you build upon what you read?
How do you effectively turn information into knowledge? The secret lies in
having an active attitude towards remembering things, and not just passively consume content.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/42625902@N00/2641415853/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3061/2641415853_325ea48e8e_n.jpg" alt="Siri helps Doggy" /></a>

<h2>Write it Down</h2>

<p>Writing things down has a number of wonderful consequences.</p>

<p>First of all
the information is &#8220;safer&#8221; in the sense that it is now written down in a
place from which it is easier to retrieve in its actual form than from
your unconscious brain. Not only that but it also ensures that the
information stays put and doesn&#8217;t change. One cannot say the same holds
true for memories, as the brain changes them all the time. Memories are
very volatile and often the brain tampers with them to spin them more
positively or make them more relevant to the context. Writing down will prevent
information from being distorted by your unconscious brain.</p>

<p>Additionally, writing things down will actually strengthen your memories.
When you write full sentences that
are grammatically correct (or close to correct at least), you must
formalize relationships between facts, entities, people, and concepts.
The brain being better suited to memorize relationships and patterns,
it will be easier for you to memorize that way instead of simply highlighting a few
words or numbers here and there that aren&#8217;t linked together by explicit relationships. (Think of a graph.)</p>

<p>Last but not least, text is universal. Information in writing is easily
accessible and shareable. This is important because for instance say you
store information in other formats such as audio or video, it
won&#8217;t be as easily retrieved and accessed. This is why I love blogposts
but am not a fan of podcasts or videos that don&#8217;t include a &#8220;textified&#8221;
version.</p>

<p>In that regard, I write summaries of what I read and find most
interesting and useful. It is important to summarize relationships and
not facts only, so that it matches the brain&#8217;s memorizing process.</p>

<h2>Practice</h2>

<p>Musicians are known for their disciplined rehearsals. When I was 10
years old I started learning to play the piano. My parents would pay
this private tutor that came once a week and insisted I play 3 hours of
piano per day. At this time I was of course way to enthralled by my
Playstation to care, but I do regret it now. So I didn&#8217;t practice like I
should have, and the promising career as a pianist that lied ahead of me
ground to a screeching halt. However some of my friends heroically put in the
effort and I can see now that practice makes perfect.</p>

<p>Where does that all fit with memorizing and building knowledge? The goal is to
apply the methods of musicians to the practice of building knowledge. In that
case, practicing means a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write an interesting bit of knowledge down in different ways, targetting varied audiences (yourself, your family,
friends, colleagues, etc.)</li>
<li>Talk about it to people who have a varying level of understanding of
that particular topic. They will ask you questions you didn&#8217;t expect
and force you to dig deeper and strengthen your knowledge.</li>
<li>Weave blobs of knowledge together. By that I mean think about what one
relationship in a given domain means if applied to another one. (For
instance Math and Computer Science, or Sociology and Networks,
Math and Art, etc.) Bridging domains will often make great insights and
ideas pop in your head and further strengthen your understanding and
memory of a bit of knowledge.</li>
</ul>


<p>Capitalizing on what you read by writing it down and practicing will
slowly (but surely!) turn you in a walking encyclopedia. You will be able to remember
a lot more things than you are used to, and gradually gain a deeper
understanding of what you memorize.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you build a website, you will want your own domain name, which means
you will need to manage your Domain Name System (DNS). While there is nothing very
complicated here, the info is scattered across the Internet, so I decided
to write a &#8220;cheat sheet&#8221;-like tutorial which will hopefully save you some time!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/49502986585@N01/277341190/"><img src="http://farm1.staticflickr.com/122/277341190_3f098a08a4_n.jpg" alt="Code" /></a>
<em>by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ezu/" title="Author">Ezu</a></em></p>

<h2>What is the DNS?</h2>

<p>The DNS is a system that helps your computer translate human-readable <strong>domain names</strong>
into computer-usable <strong>IP addresses</strong> (4 numbers between 0 and 255
identifying a server).</p>

<p>A domain name must have two parts, separated by a dot: the <strong>actual domain</strong> (e.g. <em>google</em>) and the
<strong>top-level domain</strong> (e.g. <em>com</em>). In this example, the domain name is
<em>google.com</em>. Optionally, you can also use different <strong>subdomains</strong>, so
that users typing <em>subdomain1.domain.tld</em> and <em>subdomain2.domain.tld</em>
arrive on two different pages. The well-known <em>www</em> is a subdomain of
<em>google.com</em> in the address <em>www.google.com</em>.</p>

<p>To use your own custom domain name, you need
to buy one from a <strong>registrar</strong> (such as <a href="https://www.gandi.net/">Gandi</a>).</p>

<h2>How to manage it: the zone file</h2>

<p>Most registrars will let you use Web forwardings, which are simple
redirections (what happens when the webpage you are looking at automatically changes to another page). However, you should
avoid those for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
<li>Simple redirections will replace your domain name by your IP address,
which is the best way to scare off users</li>
<li>Masked redirections will not scare off users, but they will give you a
very poor search-engine rating</li>
</ul>


<p>You will need to use the <strong>zone file</strong>. It is a simple text file
describing the structure of your DNS zone (usually your domain) to the global DNS
(i.e. the world). Let&#8217;s take a look at a sample zone file (the zone file on
Gandi for our blog <a href="http://needforair.com">needforair.com</a>.</p>

<p>These are the DNS rules for our domain <code>needforair.com</code>:</p>

<pre><code>@ 3600 IN A 184.106.20.102
www 3600 IN CNAME needforair.com.
wik 3600 IN CNAME fr.wikipedia.org.
</code></pre>

<p>You usually also find lines similar to the following in a zone file.
They manage the email server your registrar provides you, and shouldn&#8217;t
touch them:</p>

<pre><code>@ 3600 IN MX 10 spool.mail.gandi.net.
@ 3600 IN MX 50 fb.mail.gandi.net.
smtp 3600 IN CNAME relay.mail.gandi.net.
webmail 3600 IN CNAME agent.mail.gandi.net.
pop 3600 IN CNAME access.mail.gandi.net.
imap 3600 IN CNAME access.mail.gandi.net.
</code></pre>

<p>The most important points here are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each line corresponds to one rule (a record)</li>
<li>The <code>@</code> character represents your bare domain (needforair.com in our example) as opposed
to subdomains such as <code>test.needforair.com</code> or <code>www.needforair.com</code></li>
<li>An <code>A</code> record points to an IP address, usually your server. In our example, <code>@ 3600 IN A 184.106.20.102</code>
indicates that a user typing &#8216;needforair.com&#8217; in his address bar will request content from the IP address 184.106.20.102.
The <code>3600</code> number is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live#DNS_records">Time To Live (TTL)</a> of the record,
the time (in seconds) during which a nameserver will cache the record and not ask the authoritative server (Gandi here)
if queried again</li>
<li>A <code>CNAME</code> record points to any domain or subdomain, either in your zone or outside.
In our example, <code>www 3600 IN CNAME needforair.com.</code> means that a user typing <code>www.needforair.com</code> will request content
from the same IP address as needforair.com (that&#8217;s not the case by default). You can of course use a CNAME to any other
domain, in our example <code>wik 3600 IN CNAME fr.wikipedia.org.</code> which will make users typing &#8220;wik.needforair.com&#8221; in their
address bar go to the French version of Wikipedia instead (don&#8217;t try it
we removed it!)</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t forget the period (&#8216;.&#8217;) at the end of your CNAMEs !!!</strong> For example, use &#8220;needforair.com.&#8221;, and NOT &#8220;needforair.com&#8221;.
If you forget the period, the record simply won&#8217;t work, and you will
spend an awful lot of time to figure out why</li>
</ul>


<p>There are lots of other types of rules, but this should be enough to set up your DNS.</p>

<p>Last note: keep in mind that <strong>changes to the zone file take some time</strong>,
usually a few hours, to propagate through the Internet. So don&#8217;t make a
mistake or they will take some time to spot and correct!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The other day I had a conversation on Twitter with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/rjs">Ryan
Singer</a> of <a href="http://37signals.com">37 Signals</a>
fame. Ryan is a world-class expert in product design and had just posted an <a href="http://feltpresence.com/articles/16-managing-product-development-by-integrating-around-concerns">article</a>
on his excellent <a href="http://feltpresence.com/">blog</a>. The thing is I am a
nobody in product design or in the tech scene in general. I&#8217;m not saying
I&#8217;m dumb or anything, just that nobody knows me. And yet I was
still able to have a great and stimulating conversation with an expert
who&#8217;s email inbox is presumably very full, lives thousands of kilometers
away from me and doesn&#8217;t know anything about me. This was not the first
time I&#8217;ve been amazed by the power of Twitter, so I decided to blog about
it.</p>

<h2>140 characters Enable Improbable Conversations</h2>

<p>That length constraint compels people to get straight to the point.
There is no fluff. No awkward openings, no pompous endings, no walls of
text. People expect direct questions and answers and wouldn&#8217;t have it any other
way.</p>

<p>This magically enables you to talk to some people you would never have sent an
email to. And busy people that don&#8217;t know you at all, that might be
thought leaders or experts, will answer you if
you ask an interesting question. Because the constraint also works for
the response: they don&#8217;t have to send you a long well thought-out answer,
they don&#8217;t need to get context to answer, they can just type 140
characters.</p>

<p>I have asked questions to succesful entrepreneurs, or VCs, and almost
always gotten a quick answer. This is incredibly cool and powerful. And
these people don&#8217;t know me at all.</p>

<h2>No Social Pressure or Awkwardness</h2>

<p>The Twitter feed moves so swiftly that conversations are extremely
ephemeral. I think this is key to enabling these kinds of improbable
conversations. The fact that it moves so quickly reduces the social
pressure: few people will see it, it will not mark your Twitter profile
for a long time, and nobody will assume that the two people conversing
are great friends or anything. Twitter enables conversations in a
vacuum, without having to build up a relationship. There is no pressure
for the expert to become friend with the person he is talking to.</p>

<p>When you try to email or talk on the phone to an expert, you always want to be super apologetic,
respectful and you don&#8217;t really focus on the content of the
conversation you&#8217;re trying to have but instead you focus on the
asymmetry of the relationship and that makes you uncomfortable. Twitter makes all these concerns vanish.</p>

<p>I love Twitter for these opportunities.</p>
