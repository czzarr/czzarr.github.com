<h3><a href="http://www.nirandfar.com/2012/02/habits-are-new-viral-why-startups-must.html" title="Source">Habits Are The New Viral: Why Startups Must Be Behavior Experts</a></h3>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nireyal">@nireyal</a> - Feb 26, 2012</em></p>

<p><em>Nir Eyal describes the importance of habits besides virality for the
success of products in the Curated Web</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Habits are what matters. Web businesses success increasingly depends on the strength of their users&#8217; habitual behavior</li>
<li>Web 1.0 companies measured success by pageviews and CPM, whereas new (social) companies proved  to be valuable because they were habit-forming (hot triggers, variable rewards, regular check-in&#8230;)</li>
<li>At the dawn of the Curated Web, companies must build habit creation into their products and business models. Not only are users inundated by distractions, but acquiring users is also harder than ever before</li>
<li>Companies which successfully create user habits can build huge enterprises, even without viral growth (Evernote, Amazon)</li>
<li>The more the user engages with a Curated Web company, the more data the company has to tailor and improve the user&rsquo;s experience. This self-improving feedback loop has the potential to be more useful &ndash; and more addictive &mdash; than anything we&rsquo;ve seen before</li>
</ul>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/joshconstine">@JoshConstine</a> - Feb 26, 2012</em></p>

<p><em>Josh Constine reports the move of Facebook Analytics Tool Insights to
Real Time and describes all the possibilities it will enable</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Page performance data in (near) real-time rather than on average 48 hour delay could enable businesses to reach higher ROIs</li>
<li>Immediate &ldquo;people talking about this&rdquo; data could give marketers a sense of a post&rsquo;s virality, and indicate if they should modify the content or the apps they link to</li>
<li>&ldquo;Insights API give Page owners an opportunity to see how their Page actually lives and breathes&rdquo;.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s up to us as tool developers to turn that data into something awesome and present it in relevant actionable analytics.&rdquo;</li>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/jordankurzweil">@JordanKurzweil</a> - Feb 25, 2012</em></p>

<p><em>Jordan Kurzweil describes the context of &ldquo;digital magazination&rdquo; of content. He states some recommendations to straighten up print business. At the heart of his reflexion is personalized and curated content</em></p>

<ul>
<li>PRINT IS DEAD. revenue, subscriptions and circulation are declining</li>
<li>What can Old Print do to survive? Stop rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic, grow a pair, and change your business model:

<ul>
<li>Accept this evolution (aging and fragmentation of audience, concurrency from other digital media &#8230;) and embrace it</li>
<li>Start thinking like startups: use some of your profits to incubate new ideas (e.g. Washington post personalized headlines)</li>
<li>Rethink your organization : everyone should be a doer, contributing 100 percent of her/his work hours to making things</li>
<li>Stop thinking that technology serves content: they are now one and the same, each working with the other to delight and engage your users</li>
<li>Update web platforms</li>
<li>Use data to inform your editorial and product decisions</li>
<li>Break down the wall between editors, writers and readers</li>
<li>Consider your content as a currency, not the end-all be-all but a means to an end</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When working on a project we always face repetitive tasks. But we shouldn&#8217;t have to spend as much time on those tasks as we usually do. We love
to think: &#8221;<em>I just have to do it once and I won&#8217;t have to do it again</em>&#8221; But we never have to do it only once, be it for the current project or
the next one.</p>

<p><img src="http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1073/1352003098_1681416c2d_m.jpg" title="Keyboard" alt="Illustration" /></p>

<p><strong>Automate by scripting</strong><br/>
Task repetition can be solved in a painless way: scripting. When you don&#8217;t automate repetitive work you waste time. We should always see mechanical tasks as potential scripts. It&#8217;s only
because we tend to procrastinate and we don&#8217;t face this reality that we
postpone the moment we start scripting.</p>

<p><strong>Save your time</strong><br/>
I think scripting is a very important activity, above
all because it makes us save a lot of time. The inputs changed? No problem, just
rerun the script and you&#8217;re done.</p>

<p><strong>Ship a product</strong><br/>
I love scripting because a script is something concrete and useful. By writing our custom
script we <em>&#8220;scratch our own itch&#8221;</em>, we solve our own problem with our
own technical skills, which always provides an immense satisfaction. Coding a script is like shipping a
small product!</p>

<p>In addition, it helps us develop and extend our programming
skills. It improves our knowledge of the scripting language and it makes us
discover API wrappers.</p>

<p><strong>Do it right</strong><br/>
When working in a team, scripting is even more useful. It&#8217;s
more than likely that our teamates will have to do later whar we are doing now. On top of that, scripting for a team forces us
to write good quality code because our users are our teammates. They
won&#8217;t be as indulgent as we are regarding our work, we don&#8217;t want them
to think that we are poor coders, so we do it right.</p>

<p><strong>Improve creativity and productivity</strong><br/>
The next time you think &#8220;it would be so nice to automate this work&#8221;, spend some time to look for a scripting solution ! The more you script the better you will become at it. So take some time thinking about what you are doing, you will see
how it improves your creativity and your productivity.</p>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/albertwenger">Albert Wenger</a> - February 29, 2012</em></p>

<ul>
<li>There is so much new content on the Web every day that one can barely
keep up with it</li>
<li>It is becoming ever harder to delve into the past, a problem
aggravated by Google&#8217;s recent tilt of their search algorithm towards
recency</li>
<li>We need to surface time explicitly. For example, imagine a version of
Techmeme where you can see the historical precedents of any post, or a
search engine that allows you to &#8220;scroll&#8221; into the past of any result</li>

<p><em>by <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/courteney-palis">Courteney Palis, Huffington Post</a> - February 29, 2012</em></p>

<p><em>Palis describes the $35-a-piece Raspberry PI micro-computer and the
implications for the teaching of computer science</em></p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>The Raspberry Pi device</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A complete computer for $35</li>
<li>Credit-card sized</li>
<li>&#8220;Last-decade&#8221; hardware (700 Mhz processor, 256 MB RAM) that&#8217;s still
enough to run Linux, code, browse the internet and even play games such
as Quake 3 !</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>What this means</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Programming can be learned by almost anyone</li>
<li>People in poor areas, children in poor schools get access to technology</li>
<li>Like the Kinect, the Raspberry Pi will enable hackers to build ever
more impressive prototypes. The possibilities are endless</li>

<p><em>Fred Wilson explains why he thinks the Raspberry Pi is a game changer</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Hardware that&#8217;s currently expensive (phones and especially tablets)
is going to be cheaper and cheaper. We will see sub $100 tablets in 3 to
5 years</li>
<li>The Raspberry Pi&#8217;s goal is, according to the developper, to entice
children to learn to code. But all markets that can be end-to-end
digital, not just education, will be disrupted</li>

<h3><a href="http://bhorowitz.com/2012/02/29/lies-that-losers-tell/" title="Source">Lies that Losers Tell</a></h3>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/bhorowitz">@bhorowitz</a> - Feb 29, 2012</em></p>

<p><em>Ben Horowitz describes the false explanations CEOs and employees find a
posteriori to justify their failure and why they do that. Stop burrying
your head in the sand.</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Familiar lies</strong>

<ul>
<li>“<em>She left, but we were going to fire her, or give her a bad performance review</em>” : Instead of justifying the departure of your employees giving false excuses, ask yourself why you couldn&#8217;t keep them.</li>
<li>“<em>We would have won, but the other guys gave the deal away</em>” : Validate this claim with the actual customer instead of believing the Sales Rep who doesn&#8217;t want to take the blame.</li>
<li>&#8220;<em>Just because we missed the intermediate milestones doesn’t mean we won’t hit our product schedule</em>&#8221; : When the facts don’t align with the good news, a clever manager will find the narrative to make everybody feel better&#8230; until the next meeting.</li>
<li>“<em>We have a very high churn rate, but as soon as we turn on email marketing to our user base, people will come back</em>” : The reason that people leave our service and don’t come back is that we have not been sending them enough spam ?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Why are the CEOs/employees lying ?</strong>

<ul>
<li>Andy Grove explains that humans, particularly those who build things, only listen to leading indicators of good news and tend to justify bad news with false excuses.</li>
<li>Lying CEOs regularly take action on the positive indicator and look for alternative explanations on the negative indicator.</li>
<li>CEOs are not lying to investors, they are lying to themselves.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>For 1.5 year people forgot Web Second and just thought Mobile First</strong>

<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s important not give up on the power of the tethered web, of large screen real estate, of a keyboard.</li>
<li>What&#8217;s even more important is to have a strategy that matches
customers wants and not developers whims.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Mobile has clearly critical attributes</strong>

<ul>
<li>They are personal, location aware, occupy a lot of people&#8217;s leisure
time.</li>
<li>They are one touch away from buying and represent the &#8221;<em>bottom
end of the sales funnel</em>&#8221;</li>
<li>The limited real estate forces less choice and offers more focus on
the content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>But products have to be integrated</strong>

<ul>
<li>Many things cannot be done on a mobile</li>
<li>Mobile should serve a different experience, a different usecase of the service.</li>
<li>The web product can offer complementary services that make the
product even more attractive.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Leverage the web to :</strong>

<ul>
<li>Create a differentiated product vs your mobile-only competitors.</li>
<li>Enable content creation and curation to make mobile consumption a better experience.</li>
<li>Organize and make the most of the content created by the mobile</li>
<li>Build features that make using native-phones apps pointless.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Tablets come third</strong>

<ul>
<li>Extension to mobile strategy (larger real estate make content
  discovery different, increase the features possible&#8230;)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p><em>by <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/codinghorror">@codinghorror</a> - Feb 3, 2012</em></p>

<p><em>Jeff Atwoods talks about the need to organize your community feedback
to take the most out of it</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Having a meta place to discuss the product is important</strong>

<ul>
<li>Meta participation is the source of all meaningful leadership and governance in a community, so it is cultivated and monitored closely.</li>
<li>Meta is for people who care so deeply about their community that they&#8217;re willing to go one step further, to come together and spend even more of their time deciding how to maintain and govern it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How to leverage this meta place ?</strong>

<ul>
<li>Animate the place : listen, respond</li>
<li>Sort between feedback and feature requests</li>
<li>Know how to extract core information and underlying needs from feature requests</li>
<li>Know to sort between useless and awesome feedback, 10% of the feedback is useful and can be gems</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t hesitate to be honest explaining the choices the company did
about the features the product offers.</li>
